At its core, Facebook operates four of the most widely used social media apps in the world, all of which have over 1 billion monthly active users. As such, since early October, Nvidia stock has dropped 50%. Moreover, concerns regarding a global economic slowdown have called into question the health of Netflix's international growth narrative.Altogether, Netflix stock hasn't been itself over the past few months.
