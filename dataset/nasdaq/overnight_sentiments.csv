Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos Accuses National Enquirer Owner Of 'extortion & Blackmail'


 (RTTNews.com) - Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post and founder of Amazon.com Inc, has accused the National Enquirer's owner of trying to blackmail him over lewd pictures.
Bezos said the magazine's parent company American Media Inc or AMI wanted him to drop an investigation into how it obtained his private messages.
Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, said last month they were getting divorced.
Their announcement came just before the National Enquirer carried reports about the tech titan's extramarital affair.
In a blog post on Thursday, Bezos posted an email he said had been sent to his intermediaries by AMI's representatives threatening to publish ""intimate photos"" of Bezos and his lover, former TV host Lauren Sanchez.
The billionaire said AMI had wanted him to make a ""false public statement"" that the National Enquirer's coverage of him and his mistress was not politically motivated.
According to emails included by Mr Bezos in his blog, an AMI lawyer proposed on Wednesday that the photos would not be published in return for a public statement ""affirming that have no knowledge or basis"" to suspect such a motive.
""Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail,"" wrote Mr Bezos, ""I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.""
Early in the blog post, Mr Bezos mentions AMI's links to President Donald Trump.
Bezos said his ownership of the Washington Post was a ""complexifier"" for him because he had made enemies of ""certain powerful people"", including President Donald Trump, who is a friend of AMI's boss David Pecker.
Mr Bezos notes in his blog post how the publisher confessed to the so-called ""catch and kill"" deal to bury Karen McDougal's politically embarrassing story.
AMI's agreement to co-operate with federal authorities means it will not face criminal charges over the payments, Manhattan prosecutors announced in December.

WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.com Inc, has accused the owner of the National Enquirer of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing ""intimate photos"" he allegedly sent to his girlfriend unless he said in public that the supermarket tabloid's reporting on him was not politically motivated.
The accusation, published in a blog post, is the latest twist in a weeks-long saga that has brought the world's richest person's private life into the spotlight and thrusts him deeper into a battle with the leading U.S. tabloid publisher, which has had close links with the president of the United States.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
American Media Inc (AMI), the owner of the National Enquirer, did not immediately return a request for comment.
Bezos and his wife announced last month that they were divorcing after 25 years of marriage, following a period of ""loving exploration"" and trial separation. That same day, the National Enquirer touted it was publishing alleged intimate text messages between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former television anchor whom he was said to be dating.
Shortly after that, Bezos opened an investigation into the leak led by Gavin de Becker, a longtime security consultant and former appointee of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. De Becker proceeded to tell media that the leak was politically motivated.
Bezos, Amazon and the newspaper he owns privately, the Washington Post, have all been targets of attacks on Twitter by U.S. President Donald Trump.
The Washington Post has published many articles critical of the president. It acts as Amazon's ""chief lobbyist,"" Trump has said on Twitter, without presenting evidence. Trump called Bezos ""Jeff Bozo"" in a tweet last month about the National Enquirer's coverage of his divorce.
""It's unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,"" Bezos wrote. ""President Trump is one of those people, obvious by his many tweets.""
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In his blog, Bezos cited an email from AMI deputy general counsel, Jon Fine, to a lawyer representing de Becker. In it, AMI proposed a public acknowledgment from Bezos and de Becker that ""they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that (AMI's) coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.""
In return for such an acknowledgement, according to the email, AMI offered ""not to publish, distribute, share, or describe unpublished texts and photos.""
Bezos said the statement AMI was proposing was false and described the offer as an ""extortionate proposal.""
Fine and de Becker could not immediately be reached for comment.
The alleged extortion raises questions among some legal observers about whether AMI and its chief executive David Pecker have violated a cooperation agreement AMI made last year with federal prosecutors in connection with a $150,000 hush-money payment given to Karen McDougal, the Playboy model who claims she had an affair with President Donald Trump.
The payment was made during the 2016 presidential election to influence that election, according to the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY). The deal not to prosecute was conditional on AMI not committing another crime, the office said.
A spokesman for the SDNY attorney's office declined to comment on the matter. 
Bezos, who owns more than $120 billion in Amazon stock, said in his blog: ""If in my position I can't stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?""

That same day, the National Enquirer touted it was publishing alleged intimate text messages between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former television anchor whom he was said to be dating.
Since the affair, Bezos opened an investigation into the leak led by Gavin de Becker, a public safety expert and former appointee of U.S. President Ronald Reagan. De Becker proceeded to tell media that the leak was politically motivated.
Bezos, Amazon and the newspaper he owns privately, the Washington Post, have all been targets of attacks on Twitter by U.S. President Donald Trump.
""It's unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,"" Bezos wrote. ""President Trump is one of those people, obvious by his many tweets.""
The suggestion that the National Enquirer's reporting on him  was politically motivated concerned AMI, according to Bezos.
In his blog, Bezos reproduces an email from AMI deputy general counsel, Jon Fine, to a lawyer representing de Becker. In it, AMI proposes a public acknowledgment from Bezos and de Becker that ""they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that (AMI's) coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.""

""Clearly Bezos will have a civil claim against AMI if they chose to bring it, but the question is whether it is criminal,"" said David Berger, a litigation partner with Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.
Bezos, who owns more than $120 billion in Amazon stock, said in his blog: ""If in my position I can't stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?""

 Wall Street didn't show much love for   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) after its earnings report last week, but then, the   market does have a weakness for short-term thinking. Yes,   management's projections for next quarter were a little light,   and yes, the company plans to spend more to build out its   infrastructure. But as    Motley Fool Money     host Chris Hill and senior analysts Andy Cross, Ron Gross, and   Jason Moser discuss in this segment from the podcast, the   e-commerce powerhouse is being run with the long term in   mind. They reflect on where AWS is headed, concerns about the future   of online sales in India, Jeff Bezos' strategy, and the odd way   that   Apple    's model and Amazon's are converging -- or trading places. And   Moser -- counseling patience -- reminds us of the number that   shareholders should focus on.

Click here to get access to the full       list!   *Stock Advisor returns as of November 14, 2018    This video was recorded on Feb. 1, 2019.   Chris Hill:    The Web Services business grew 45%, but Wall Street seemed   otherwise unimpressed with Amazon's fourth-quarter report. Shares   falling a bit on Friday, Jason.  Jason Moser:    Wall Street is very hard to please sometimes, Chris.  Ron Gross:    A fickle bunch.  Moser:    You see it time and time again. The reason I think Wall Street is   proceeding with a little bit of caution, the important thing to   remember with Amazon is the metric that ultimately matters for   this business: simple top-line revenue. That's the fuel that   really keeps this engine humming. From that perspective, the   company is performing well. First-quarter projections for   management were perhaps a little bit lighter than what Wall   Street was expecting. When you have that, along with the fact   that now we're expecting them to hit another stage of investing   in the business to build out this infrastructure, it's   understandable if there's a little bit of trepidation out there.   But this is the same great business that we knew even a week   ago. Perhaps there are some concerns there in regard to India.   They've been making a lot of investments there recently. But   there were some changes to the e-commerce legislation there   essentially tantamount to antitrust concerns that might make   it a little bit more difficult for not only Amazon, but Flipkart   as well, which is owned by   Walmart    . All in all, though, it's still the same business, taking that   same long-term approach. Amazon Web Services, as you mentioned,   doing really well. Trailing-12-month sales now of almost $26   billion. Operating income for the quarter up 57%. It's really   just a matter of, are you willing to take that patient long-term   approach with this company? I recommend that you do. I know I   am.  Gross:    Yeah, and let's not forget, all those investments take a chunk   out of the bottom line. While they're profitable to the tune of a   few billion dollars, they could be significantly more profitable   if they turn that investment spigot off. They choose to build for   the future. I think that's a smart move. Bezos knows what he's   doing. He's not really that concerned about quarterly profits,   which I like. They could be more profitable if they wanted to be   right now, but they're playing the long game.  Moser:    It's interesting to see how Apple and Amazon are coming to this   crossroads here. Apple's always done such a good job of making   money from selling the devices. Now, they're trying to make money   on us using those devices. Amazon's philosophy has always been,   ""We're going to make money from you using our devices, not really   from buying the devices."" We're seeing these two businesses hit a   little bit of a different point of the strategy at this stage in   their lives.

23,"February 07, 2019, 08:36:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Amazon Is Running Away With the Smart-Speaker Market,"
 The latest data for the smart-speaker market was just released   -- and things are looking great for   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) . The company's Echo devices hold about 70% of the   market right now, which is about what they had at the end of   2017. Meanwhile,   Alphabet    's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Home devices have just   24%, and   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) HomePod is far behind with only 6% of the   market, according to   data     from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP). These market percentages don't include third-party and   off-brand speakers, which hold a small percentage of the market.   CIRP says that when these vendors are included, the market shares   for Amazon, Google, and Apple would change slightly, but not   significantly. Aside from Amazon's dominance, the smart-speaker market   overall is still experiencing tremendous growth. The U.S. had an   installed base of 36 million smart speakers in the fourth quarter   of 2017, and that figure rose to 66 million in the fourth quarter   of 2018 -- representing an 83% spike year over year.     makeArticleAd(); This growth is good for all of the smart-speaker players, of   course, but there are a few reasons Amazon's lead is particularly   valuable to the company.   An Echo smart speaker. Image source: Amazon.   Why Amazon's lead matters  Even though these are still the early days of the   smart-speaker market, Amazon has already managed to use its   speakers to grow its top line. Echo owners spend, on average,   about $700 more every year than Amazon customers who don't own   one, and   $400 more annually    than Amazon Prime members without an Echo. That's because Amazon   makes it easy for users to reorder items with simple voice   commands to their Echo device, or initiate new purchases with   just a few words. With Echo devices always listening, it's easy   for users to add items to their Amazon cart. The great news for Amazon, and Google to an extent, is that   U.S. consumers are not only ramping up their smart-speaker usage,   but they're also starting to buy more than one device for their   homes. At the end of 2017, just 18% of U.S. households with a   smart speaker owned multiple devices; now that percentage is up   to 35%. With Amazon dominating in smart speakers and more devices   coming into users' homes each year, it has a lot of potential to   drive additional sales from its   e-commerce platform    . In fact, RBC Capital estimates that Echo devices will add $10   billion to Amazon's revenue by next year. Additionally, grabbing a significant piece of the   smart-speaker market automatically puts Amazon at the top of the   smart-home space, which itself will be worth an estimated $151   billion by 2024. Amazon's Echo devices can be used as smart-home   hubs for other devices -- like alarms, lights, and door locks --   and as this market grows, it could further lock users into   Amazon's ecosystem and make its Echo devices even more   lucrative.  Watch this space  Amazon's early moves into the smart-speaker market have   certainly paid off, and the company is already reaping the   benefits through additional e-commerce sales. But I think   investors should continue to watch this space closely because   Amazon could benefit from more than just online sales. The company is no doubt collecting data about what its   customers are purchasing through their Echo devices, when they're   doing it, how much they spend, and so on -- and all this data is   valuable to the company's budding   advertising business    . Investors should remember that Amazon's Echo devices are more   than just novel consumer devices designed for asking questions --   they're cash cows that will help drive more revenue for years to   come.

Feb 7 (Reuters) - GrubHub Inc's  fourth quarter results missed analysts' estimates on Thursday as the online food delivery company continues to increase spending on marketing and expansion activities to attract more people to its platforms.
Shares of the company fell 13 percent in premarket trading on Thursday.
GrubHub, which has been under heavy pressure from rivals Amazon.com Inc  owned Amazon Restaurants and Uber Eats, has been an active player in the acquisitions market and spends heavily on expanding its delivery network and marketing activities.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Uber Eats could also raise the pressure on GrubHub if its deep-pocketed parent Uber Technologies Inc  were to use some of the added funding it would get in a potential IPO which it has confidentially filed for with the U.S. SEC. 
GrubHub reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $5.2 million, or 6 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a profit of $53.5 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, the company earned 19 cents per share, missing analysts' average estimate of 28 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue rose about 40 percent to $287.7 million, also missing analysts estimate of $290.5 million.

OSLO, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Norway's$1 trillion wealth fund will push the 9,000 firms it invests in to disclose more data on greenhouse gases they emit and how they adapt to climate change during the coming annual general meeting season, a top fund official said.
The world's largest sovereign wealth fund invests the revenues of Norway's oil and gas production and has stakes in some 9,000 companies across 72 countries.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
This year, it will make a fresh push on firms to explain how their business will be affected, and how they are adapting, to a world where temperatures may rise by 2 degrees Celsius (35.6°F).
""What we would like to see more of is scenarios, including a two-degree scenario, and we want better disclosure of the assumptions for these scenarios,"" Carine Smith Ihenacho, the fund's chief corporate governance officer, told Reuters.
""We want clear targets for CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases, including methane. And we want to see reporting of progress against the targets,"" she added.
""We would like to see it more disaggregated, meaning not for  the whole company, but more broken down, for instance regional or even on an asset level.""


DIVESTMENTS
As part of its green push, the fund has been developing an in-house software, called Angle, that can take non-financial data, such as CO2 emissions, combine it with trading data and earnings data, and see how it will affect a company years ahead.
That tool has informed divestments in some 30 companies in 2018, fund CEO Yngve Slyngstad told Reuters, helping show that these companies did not have a sustainable business model over the long-term. He did not name them.
Presentation material showed two of the 30 divested companies were involved in palm oil; one in rubber; ten in coal-based power; and one in ""CO2 intensity"".   
The next step in the software's development, first disclosed by Reuters in October, is to develop the platform to see how much of the carbon cost can be passed on to customers and how much companies must pay themselves.
""It is still in the works,"" Slyngstad said.
Smith Ihenacho said companies were generally better at reporting climate-related data, citing for instance banks and oil and gas companies as ""quite good"" examples. 
But others, like power producers, were lagging.
""There is still far to go for many companies to report at the level we would like to see,"" she said.
The fund itself ""emitted"" 107 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2018 via its ownership stakes -- roughly twice the amount emitted by Norway in 2017 -- according to its annual responsible investment report released on Thursday.
In 2018, the fund voted against one or more resolutions put forward at 27.5 percent of AGMs it attended last year, roughly the same level as in 2017.
The fund said it voted against the CEO also holding the position of board chairman at Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, Total, Procter & Gamble  and Pfizer, among others.
It also voted against executive pay proposals at JP Morgan Chase, Verizon, AstraZeneca  and GlaxoSmithKline, among others.

By Promit Mukherjee and Subrata Nag Choudhury
MUMBAI/KOLKATA, Feb 7 (Reuters) - India'sReliance Industries will invest 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) in the eastern state of West Bengal, a part of which would fund the company's new e-commerce venture, its chairman Mukesh Ambani said on Thursday.
The energy and telecoms conglomerate, which already runs retail stores, has announced plans to diversify into e-commerce at a time when India's new foreign investment curbs have dealt a blow to Amazon.com Inc  and Walmart's  Flipkart. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Ambani's so-called ""new commerce"" venture aims to connect small merchants with his retail network and warehouses, helping them better manage their inventory. It already has more than 500 retail stores in the state, selling everything from clothes to groceries, and the new plan would ""increase manifold"" its warehouse space in the next 24 months in West Bengal, he said.
The new e-commerce platform ""will bring win-win benefits to consumers, retailers and producers"" and help 30 million small shopkeepers, Ambani said.
The billionaire businessman has been more vocal about his e-commerce plans after India in December imposed new restrictions on how foreign companies operate in the e-commerce sector. The new rules, which kicked in on Feb. 1, have disrupted product listings on Amazon.com'sIndia website. 
Addressing a business summit in West Bengal's Kolkata city, Ambani also said he plans to expand the reach of his telecom services in the state and swiftly open a data centre which would be ""as good as the ones in Silicon Valley"".
""There is no area of the economy, governance or life which is untouched by the revolutionary potential of digital technologies,"" Ambani said.

By Aditya Kalra and Sankalp Phartiyal
NEW DELHI, Feb 7 (Reuters) - One of the biggest sellers on Amazon.com Inc'sIndia website has returned after the online retail giant changed its business structures to comply with new federal e-commerce curbs that took effect last week, two sources told Reuters.
India's modified foreign direct investment rules that kicked in on Feb. 1, prevent companies such as Amazon from selling products from vendors where they, or their group companies, have equity holdings. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
But on Thursday Cloudtail had returned with more than 300,000 products listed on Amazon, after the U.S. e-commerce firm cut its indirect holding to 24 percent, one of the sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The stake was bought by the majority holders, Catamaran Ventures, the source said.
""We have no equity participation in any seller company on our marketplace,"" Amazon said in a statement, without sharing details of the changes in its indirect holding of Cloudtail.
Catamaran, an investment firm launched by Infosys  founder N.R. Narayana Murthy, said it had made ""required changes"" to comply with the rules, but did not elaborate.
Amazon is working on a similar restructuring for the other big seller, Appario, a second source said.
The sources declined to be named as they were not authorized to discuss the same with media.
The new rules were introduced after complaints from small Indian traders who said Amazon and Walmart-owned online retailer Flipkart used their control over inventory from affiliated vendors to unfairly offer discounts.
The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which has pushed for tougher scrutiny of e-commerce players, on Thursday alleged Amazon's latest move was a circumvention of the new rules.
The group would ask India's industries department to clarify that online retailers should not hold direct or indirect stakes in their vendors, CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal told Reuters.
The industries department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Amazon and Walmart Inc  had unsuccessfully lobbied against the latest rules and pushed for a delay in their implementation.
While product listings on Amazon have been disrupted, Flipkart has been less impacted as it had no equity holdings in its vendors.
Flipkart's sellers were exhausting inventory from before the rules kicked in, and the company was working with its partners to ensure they complied with new norms when they sold new inventory on the platform, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Flipkart declined to comment.

36,"February 06, 2019, 09:13:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,"Don't Worry Amazon Fans, Whole Foods Isn't Shrinking","
 Last week,   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported earnings that underwhelmed some   investors. Shares were bid down over 5% the next day, as the   company's better-than-expected quarter was overshadowed by   weaker-than-expected guidance. One factor that may be worrying investors was a rare   year-over-year   decline    in one of Amazon's business segments: physical stores. Physical   stores are made up of Amazon's new brick-and-mortar inventions,   including the Amazon 4-star store, Amazon bookstores, and the   cashier-less Amazon Go concept store. Still, these are tiny   contributions; virtually the entire segment is made up of Whole   Foods, which Amazon acquired in the summer of 2017. Last quarter,    Amazon   report    ed a surprise 3% decline in physical store revenue. However,   investors shouldn't panic. That figure is not representative of   how Whole Foods is actually doing.makeArticleAd();   Is Whole Foods growing?  Image source: Getty     Images.  Two major adjustments Embedded in the 3% decline in physical stores were two   important adjustments. First, when Amazon acquired Whole Foods,   it had to adjust Whole Foods' reporting schedule, which shifted   about five days into the fourth quarter of 2017. Those extra days   made year-over-year comparisons a bit more difficult relative to   Q3 results. Second -- and most important -- when a customer makes a Whole   Foods order online, either for delivery or pickup outside a Whole   Foods store, it doesn't show up in the physical store segment,   but rather the, ""online store"" segment. That's important, because   since Amazon is an online-first retailer, a large part of the   thesis for buying Whole Foods was to boost Amazon's online   grocery capabilities. Management said on its   conference call with analysts    that when one adjusts for the above factors, Whole Foods sales   were actually   up    6% year-over-year. 6% for a large grocer is awesome 6% growth, while certainly lower than the rest of Amazon's   high-octane segments, is actually quite a bit better than Whole   Foods was doing prior to Amazon's purchase. It's also better than   Whole Foods' large grocery store peers. In the final quarter before Amazon's acquisition, Whole Foods   grew revenue only 0.6%. Meanwhile, competitor   Kroger    , the largest pure-play grocer, only grew sales 1.7% (adjusted   for acquisitions and divestitures) in its lates   t report    ed quarter (Q3 2018).    Target    , which has a sizable grocery businesses, grew its Q3 food and   beverage sales by 4.9%. While   Walmart     hasn't broken out total year-over-year grocery sales, it   did report   comparable grocery sales    in the ""low single digits"" on its las   t earnings    presentation. In that light, Whole Foods' results not only   weren't     a negative, they were downright positive by comparison. One could also argue that since Whole Foods has slashed prices   on select items since Amazon took over, 6% growth may be   undershooting the ""true"" growth rate (though price cuts may have   spurred a corresponding uptick in traffic). Whole Foods recently   discontinued its millennial-focused 365 store   concept    , which featured lower prices than the full-priced Whole Foods   store, in part because the difference between Whole Foods' newer   low-price regime and 365 is becoming increasingly irrelevant. Ancillary benefits Finally, Whole Foods is delivering benefits to the Amazon   ecosystem that don't necessarily show up in the physical store or   online segments. Amazon Prime customers receive proprietary 10%   discounts at Whole Foods, and these discounts could very well be   the thing that compels some to sign up or retain their Prime   memberships. Prime subscriptions are counted, unsurprisingly, in Amazon's   ""subscriptions"" segment, which grew 25% (26% excluding FX) last   quarter, to nearly $4 billion. Absent a new accounting change,   subscription growth would have been an   even stronger 34%    . On the recent call with analysts, management claimed that more   Prime members signed up in the quarter than in any other quarter   in the company's history. In addition to Prime subscriptions, Amazon offers 5% cash back   on Whole Foods purchases made through its co-branded Amazon   Rewards   Visa     card. While the extra 5% discounts are nice, should you run   up a balance on your card, you'll have to pay hefty interest   fees, and Amazon gets a significant cut of those payments. ""Whole"" lot going on underneath Contrary to worrying   media reports    about the stagnation of Whole Foods under Amazon, the acquisition   is working out quite well. 6% growth for a large grocer   (especially after price cuts) is nothing to sneeze at, and the   segment's contribution to Prime subscriptions and credit card   revenue are other benefits that don't show up in the physical   store numbers.

Last quarter,    Amazon   report    ed a surprise 3% decline in physical store revenue.
First, when Amazon acquired Whole Foods,   it had to adjust Whole Foods' reporting schedule, which shifted   about five days into the fourth quarter of 2017.
That's important, because   since Amazon is an online-first retailer, a large part of the   thesis for buying Whole Foods was to boost Amazon's online   grocery capabilities.
6% for a large grocer is awesome 6% growth, while certainly lower than the rest of Amazon's   high-octane segments, is actually quite a bit better than Whole   Foods was doing prior to Amazon's purchase.
In the final quarter before Amazon's acquisition, Whole Foods   grew revenue only 0.6%.
Ancillary benefits Finally, Whole Foods is delivering benefits to the Amazon   ecosystem that don't necessarily show up in the physical store or   online segments.

37,"February 06, 2019, 07:30:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Snap Admits Its Cloud Commitment Was Too Much,"
  Snap    (NYSE: SNAP) has stood behind its decision to rely on its cloud   infrastructure partners Google and   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) instead of building its own servers. Snap   argues    the capital-light model will eventually lead to greater cash flow   conversion. On the other hand, Snap can't realize as many   benefits of scaling. In order to reduce its infrastructure costs, Snap negotiated   two massive long-term contracts    with Google and Amazon in early 2017. The contracts were   structured with the expectation that Snap's demands for cloud   infrastructure would continue to grow rapidly. After several   quarters of losing users, Snap admitted it couldn't keep up with   its commitments and restructured its deal with Amazon in October   last year. Snap also   amended    its agreement with Google, but the details of those changes are   not public.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Snap   Comparing the new contract  Snap's original contract committed it to paying Amazon Web   Services $1 billion over five years. The new deal totals slightly   more than $1.1 billion over six years.     Year   2017   2018   2019   2020   2021   2022       Original commitment   $50 million   $125 million   $200 million   $275 million   $350 million  N/A    New commitment  N/A  $90 million   $150 million   $215 million   $280 million   $349 million     Data source: Snap annual report and S-1 registration   filings. Chart by author. N/A = not applicable. Importantly, both deals use the language: ""If we fail to meet   the minimum purchase commitment during any year, we are required   to pay the difference. Any such payment may be applied to future   use of AWS services during the addendum term, although it will   not count toward meeting the future minimum purchase commitments   under the addendum."" In other words, Snap might have to prepay   for its cloud-computing service, but it's not forfeiting the   money outright. It's unclear whether Snap faced any fees in its renegotiation   with Amazon. Snap may have had to commit to higher overall   spending in order to renegotiate without penalty. In the short term, Snap will save itself from spending $35   million on cloud computing it likely won't need this year. It'll   save even more in subsequent years. Additionally, the commitments   ramp more slowly, which is important considering the significant   slower growth outlook for Snap's user base going forward compared   to two years ago.  Is Snap better off?  Snap has spent over $1 billion on cloud-computing servers over   the last two years. That's more than 50% of its revenue during   that period. Snap interim CFO Lara Sweet points out the company's cost of   revenue is growing much more slowly than its overall revenue   growth. Indeed, the company actually saw a sequential decline in   its infrastructure costs. Sweet says that's due to ""engineering   efficiency programs"" the company put in place in 2018. But the   lower commitment to Amazon may have played a more significant   roll than Sweet lets on. From a long-term operational-efficiency perspective, it   doesn't make sense for Snap to spend hundreds of millions of   dollars on cloud computing. It could achieve better margins by   building out its own data centers and servers, considering the   size of its user base. And if Snap is really making improvements   in the efficiency of its infrastructure expenses, it could   actually benefit from those improvements instead of practically   passing on the savings to Amazon and Google due to its   commitments. While Google and Amazon were instrumental in enabling Snap to   grow quickly from the start, Snap's now relying on long-term   contracts to keep its infrastructure costs under control. That   requires a good ability to predict the future, which, as it turns   out, is really hard to do. What's more, those long-term contracts make it hard for Snap   to move away from its reliance on cloud infrastructure without   facing penalties. Considering there's not much indication that   Snap is going to need a significant increase in cloud-computing   infrastructure over the next few years -- infrastructure expenses   grew just 2% year over year in the fourth quarter -- the vicious   cycle of lengthening out its contracts with higher overall spend   requirements may continue indefinitely. Ultimately, that's going to limit Snap's gross margin and its   free cash flow -- which is only a fraction of gross profits after   all.   10 stocks we like better than Snap Inc.

By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Apple  won back its crown as the most valuable publicly listed U.S. company on Wednesday, ending the session with a market capitalization above recent leaders Microsoft  and Amazon.com.
Apple edged up 0.03 percent, putting its market value at $821.5 billion. Microsoft's market capitalization ended at $813.4 billion after its stock dipped 1.11 percent, while Amazon's stock market value finished the day at $805.7 billion, in third place, after its shares slid 1.12 percent.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
But slowing iPhone sales have led to lower expectations for Apple's stock. The average analyst price target for Apple has fallen from $240 three months ago to $175, less than a dollar more than its current stock price of $174.24.


While Apple has gained in recent sessions, Microsoft and Amazon's shares fell after their quarterly reports. Amazon has declined almost 5 percent since Thursday, when it forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates and said it would step up investments in 2019. 
""That has raised some eyebrows, it's a perception that Amazon may be settling into a more mature phase in terms of growth,"" said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta.
Morgan owns shares in Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, but he said that if forced to choose, he would favor Amazon because of its lead in cloud-computing market share.
Microsoft's stock is about flat from last Wednesday, when the software maker met targets for its quarterly results and forecast.

49,"February 06, 2019, 09:04:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,US Retail Sales to Top $3.8 Trillion in 2019: 5 Gainers,"
 U.S. retail sales are widely expected to rise between 3.8% and 4.4% to more than $3.8 trillion this year, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF). Out of the total, online sales are projected between $751.1 billion and $764.8 billion. In fact, NRF added that its preliminary estimates show retail sales growth of 4.6% to $3.68 trillion last year, surpassing NRF's forecast of at least 4.5%. This largely reflects the best holiday season shopping in nearly six years. Per the most recent Mastercard SpendingPulse report, holiday retail sales (from November 1 through December 24) grew 5.1% last year to more than $850 billion, the strongest in six years. Apparel and home improvement mostly boosted sales. Apparel sales from before Thanksgiving through Christmas rose 7.9% last year from 2017 - the best growth since 2010 - per Mastercard SpendingPulse that mostly tracks outlays in stores and online across all payment options. In fact, apparel sales picked up during the back-to-school season and accelerated right up to the Christmas season. Home improvement spending, by the way, increased across the United States at a rate of 9% over the holiday season. The trend started before the holiday season and continued through 2018. At the same time, home furniture and furnishing sales rose 2.3%. It was also a memorable year for online retail, with sales climbing 19.1% over 2017, per a Mastercard study. Major online player Amazon Inc AMZN  recorded the best holiday season sales ever. The e-commerce giant claimed that it shipped a billion products for free in the United States alone through its Amazon Prime subscription program. The NRF forecast, by the way, followed other estimates from companies like consumer research firm Customer Growth Partners (CGP). The research firm added that retail sales will total $3.77 trillion in 2019, up 5% from $3.59 trillion in 2018.  Catalysts Behind the Surge  Rising wages, robust jobs growth and low unemployment rate not only helped retail sales improve last year but are also expected to provide a boost this year. Needless to say, strong holiday sales are being fueled by a healthy U.S. economy. In the past 12 months, average hourly earnings increased 3.2% and in January, private sector employees, specially, got an average 3-cent hourly raise, adding up to an average hourly pay of $27.56. Meanwhile, the economy added 304,000 new jobs in January, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, exceeding analysts' estimates of around 172,000. December's job additions, in the meanwhile, were revised down from 312,000 jobs to 222,000, but November figure rose from 176,000 to 196,000. Nonetheless, the average for the last three months is 241,000 jobs, marking one of the best stretches during an economic expansion dating back nine-and-a-half years ago. By the way, employment gains in 2018 turned out to be the strongest in the last three years.    (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics) The jobless rate, however, ticked up to 4% from 3.9%. But, it still continues to languish at historically low levels. Further, a higher jobless rate was mostly due to the government shutdown, but it had ""no discernible impacts"" on the uptick in hiring last month, added the Labor Department.  5 Solid Picks    Taking the bullish retail sales trend into account, retailers are undoubtedly set to witness a strong year-end rally.

  The Procter & Gamble Company PG  , popularly known as P&G, has taken another step in expanding its naturals product range, which is a key focus area for most day-to-day consumer product companies at present. The company acquired a private company - This is L. - which produces period products with natural ingredients. The financial terms of the deal remained under covers.  makeArticleAd();  The L. brand portfolio mainly includes feminine hygiene products like high-quality tampons, pads, liners and wipes made of organic cotton. The company also produces condoms.    This is the latest in the series of P&G's acquisitions in this year. The acquisition fully compliments the company's Always and Tampax brands for women. Further, the companies share a common mission of boosting confidence of girls and serving more women. P&G believes that the addition of the L. brand's products to its Feminine Care business - within the Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment - will not only aid growth but also improve its exposure in the naturals segment.    As already mentioned, the naturals business has been a great attraction for consumer goods companies dealing in personal and home hygiene products. Another company that is steadfastly expanding footing in this segment is Colgate-Palmolive Company CL  .

The company continues to expand the naturals toothpaste offerings, based on local insights, with the launch of the charcoal range across many countries. Further, the Colgate Vedshakti line is witnessing increased market share gains in India. Additionally, the naturals range is a key area of focus for the company's personal and home care categories.    Meanwhile, This is L. will gain from P&G's proficiency, scale and resources that will boost opportunities to expand across global borders.

51,"February 06, 2019, 08:20:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Is Google Cloud Falling Further Behind the Competition?,"
 Cloud-computing is one of the fastest growing industries in   the world of technology. The industry is set to double in size   between 2017 and 2021, according to estimates from Gartner. Google may have gotten a late start compared to   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) and   Microsoft    (NASDAQ: MSFT) , but   Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) CFO Ruth Porat told investors last   year that Google Cloud Platform grew faster than any other   cloud-computing provider in the world in 2017. However, despite heavy investments in cloud infrastructure   last year, Porat didn't have as many details to share with   investors recently. Even when asked point-blank on   Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings call    whether she could compare growth to the company's competitors,   Porat dodged the question.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Getty Images.   A look at the competition  Google's two biggest competitors in the public cloud space are   Amazon's Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure. Both   continued to see excellent growth over the last four   quarters.    Metric  Q1 2018   Q2 2018   Q3 2018   Q4 2018       AWS revenue growth*   48%   49%   46%   46%     Azure revenue growth*   89%   85%   76%   76%     Data sources: Amazon and Microsoft. *Constant currency   basis. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood called out an increase in larger   long-term contracts as the main thing driving continued growth in   Azure, and she doesn't see that growth slowing down significantly   any time soon. Microsoft won significant contracts with retail   companies (who don't want to work with Amazon for some reason).   It also won big contracts in financial services and healthcare   (two more areas Amazon has expressed interest in entering). Amazon announced new contracts across industries including   financial services, sports leagues, and airlines, among others.   It also highlighted the progress of its SageMaker RL   machine-learning platform. Google often sells itself as the best   cloud provider for machine-learning projects due to its own   businesses relying on the infrastructure for their AI   algorithms.  Is Google falling behind?  Porat also highlighted some of the big wins for Google Cloud   in 2018. It signed on big-name financial institutions, retailers,   and media companies to use its cloud. Overall, it doubled the   number of $1 million-plus contracts as well as the number of   multiyear contracts. Last year, Porat told investors the number   of $1 million-plus contracts tripled in 2017. However, when it comes to disclosing any of the financials,   Porat and Google CEO Sundar Pichai were quiet. Last year, Porat announced Google Cloud surpassed $1 billion   per quarter and was growing faster than the competition. This   year, all she could say was, ""Cloud does continue to deliver a   sizable revenue growth, driven by [Google Cloud Platform]. And   [Google Cloud Platform] does remain one of the fastest growing   businesses across Alphabet.""  Big investments tell a story  While Porat and Pichai were quiet about specific financial   details, the growth in Google's capital expenses indicate the   company is either growing quickly or expects to do so in the   future. Google doubled its capital expenditures for the year, spending   $25.5 billion over the last 12 months. A large portion of that   CapEx went to data centers and servers, according to Porat. That   said, she expects the growth rate to slow meaningfully this   year. Amazon saw similar growth in investments in data centers and   servers in 2016 and 2017 before pulling back on spending in 2018.   Capital expenditures increased just 17% for Amazon in the fourth   quarter, and capital leases increased just 10%. Nonetheless,   Amazon Web Services continues its steady growth, so investment   rates aren't exactly tied to revenue growth. ""2018 was about   banking the efficiencies of investments in people, warehouses,   infrastructure, that we had put in place in 2016 and 2017,""   Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on the company's   fourth-quarter earnings call    . The massive growth in capital expenditures at Google is a sign   that Google's cloud business is still growing strongly. A   pullback in that spending this year is not an indication that the   outlook for the business has changed, but rather evidence that   Google could be working to gain efficiencies in the cloud   business. The lack of details about the Google Cloud Platform compared   to the competition is concerning, but the company's investments   in the business should mitigate those concerns for long-term   investors. Google is still an integral player in a rapidly   growing market, and its massive investments in cloud   infrastructure in 2018 prepare it to capitalize on the   opportunity in 2019 and beyond.   10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (C     shares)       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

By Stephen Nellis
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - A Silicon Valley venture capital firm said Wednesday that two chip and manufacturing veterans are joining it as partners as an additional funding round brings its total capital to more than $1 billion.
Palo Alto, California-based Eclipse Ventures said that it has added as partners Mike McNamara, the former chief of contract manufacturing firm Flex Ltd, and Sanjay Jha, who led chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries after a career at Qualcomm Inc  and leading phone maker Motorola Mobility.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Eclipse is unusual among venture capital firms because it invests in companies that make hardware technologies as well as software.
Despite Silicon Valley's name - which derives from the raw material for computer chips - many venture investors prefer to stick to software, advertising and commerce companies. Hardware companies can require huge amounts of capital and face intense competition from both larger rivals and cheaper imitators.
Shares of smart speaker maker Sonos Inc, for example, have declined 34 percent since its initial public offering last year, as Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc  and Apple Inc  all rolled out competing products.
But Eclipse has funded U.S.-made drones, custom chips to help cameras recognize objects quickly and a startup making robots and software for manufacturing electronics. 
Lior Susan, the firm's founding partner, said today's tech giants build both hardware and software, so he's willing to invest in both in hopes of finding the next one. Even Facebook Inc, which many investors think of as an advertising firm, spends billions of dollars on sprawling data centers and is hiring chip designers.
""If it makes sense for [a startup] to open their own factories, we're not going to say no just because it sounds hard,"" Susan told Reuters in an interview.
McNamara in October retired from contract manufacture Flex, which competes against assemblers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd'sFoxconn and has built devices for Fitbit among others. He said he is hoping to use his decades in the manufacturing business to help Eclipse-backed startups hit the market at the right time.
""Eventually, you have to know about when to expand production. Everything you do has to come out of the lab, out of the design center and hit scalability at some point,"" he told Reuters.

@media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}



Feb 6 (Reuters) - Spotify, the world's most popular paid music streaming service, reported an unexpected fourth-quarter operating profit on Wednesday and sales growth matching expectations, but it said it sees a loss of 200-360 million euros in 2019.
Spotify posted fourth-quarter operating profit of 94 million euros ($107 million) compared with a mean forecast for a loss of 16 million euros in a Reuters poll of analysts and a year-ago loss of 87 million euros.
The company, which has said it prioritizes growth over profitability, saw sales rise by 30 percent in the fourth quarter, in line with the 31 percent seen by analysts.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Investors have been concerned by Spotify's slowing rate of revenue growth. Salesgrew 29 percent in 2018, down from 39 percent growth in 2017 and 52 percent in 2016.
The service has reached 96 million paying subscribers since its launch in Sweden in 2008. That compares with around 50 million paying subscribers for its closest rival Apple Inc's  Apple Music, which launched in 2015.
Spotify's shares are down by some 6 percent since the listing in April last year on the New York Stock Exchange, weighed down by a global tech sell-off at the end of the year.
Separately, the company said it will acquire podcast companies Gimlet Media Inc and Anchor for an undisclosed amount.

Reuters

@media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}



LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - A fire at Ocado's  flagship robotic distribution centre will hit sales growth, the British online supermarket pioneer said on Wednesday, sending its shares sharply lower.
Around 20 fire engines and 200 firefighters were called to the highly automated site in Andover, southern England, at 0244 GMT on Tuesday to tackle a blaze that raged for over 24 hours.
""Whilst we are informed by the Fire Brigade that it is now under control, during the night part of the roof collapsed and there has been substantial damage to the majority of the building and its contents,"" Ocado said.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
""As a result of this incident there will be a constraint on our ability to meet our growing customer demand and there will be a reduction in sales growth until we can increase capacity elsewhere,"" it said.
Ocado said it had insurance cover for the property, stock and equipment on site, and for business interruption losses.
The Andover plant, which can process 65,000 orders a week, is Ocado's third automated warehouse and has been instrumental in the firm winning four major deals to sell its technology to international retailers such as U.S. group Kroger Co  and France's Casino.
While Ocado's first two centres required humans to load thousands of crates traveling on miles of conveyor belts, Andover has hundreds of robots speeding along at four metres per second on giant grids. 
Ocado said on Tuesday the fire had broken out on one of the grids of robots, forcing it to suspend operations.
The group was founded by three Goldman Sachs  bankers 18 years ago. After struggling for years to post a profit it has flourished in the last year and nearly doubled its stock market value after striking the technology deals.
Its shares were down 8 percent at 0922 GMT.
The group's 7 billion pound market valuation is linked to its future as a technology provider to international retailers needing to roll out online delivery services to compete with tech giants such as Amazon.
In Britain it has a 1 percent share of the grocery market.
The company on Tuesday reported full-year earnings and cautioned that investment in partnership deals would hit short-term profits.

This video was recorded on Feb. 1, 2019.   Chris Hill:    It's the   Motley Fool Money    radio show. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio, senior analysts   Jason Moser, Andy Cross, and Ron Gross. Good to see you as   always, gentlemen! We've got earnings from some of the biggest   companies out there. We will dig into the business of Super Bowl   ads. And, as always, we'll give you an inside look at the stocks   on our radar. We begin this week with the big macro. On Friday, the Commerce   Departmen   t report    ed 304,000 jobs added in January. On Wednesday, Ron, Fed Chief   Jerome Powell said the Federal Reserve was taking a patient   approach to raising rates this year. You tell me: Which one is a   bigger deal for investors?  Ron Gross:    I tell you, Chris, it's all related, but the statements and   action by the Fed are much more important. Not only does it look   like they've adopted a neutral stance with respect to rising   interest rates, but it looks like actually, there's a slight bias   in the futures market to a rate cut. Don't hang your hat on it,   however. But listen, when you get low interest rates, solid GDP,   low unemployment -- and tame inflation, all at the same time --   you take it and you run with it, because it doesn't happen all   the time.  Moser:    You kind of figure we may have to revisit at least a thesis or   two on the banking side. We've been talking a lot about how the   interest-rate environment we've been expecting would potentially   offer these banks a bit more of an opportunity at profitability.   But if rates are going to hang where they are, or perhaps even go   down -- which is amazing to think about, still -- that may delay   a little bit of what these banks may be able to do.  Andy Cross:    I think Ron's right, with the Fed being a little bit more   important here, but that employment number was pretty impressive.   Wages increased more than 3% for the sixth consecutive month now.   The employment participation rate is its highest since 2013. The   employment picture in the U.S. continues to be pretty   bullish.  Gross:    Because of that labor participation rate, you actually saw   unemployment tick up a bit and that U6 rate tick up quite a bit,   actually. There might have been some of the shutdown in there.   They say they accounted for it; I'm not so sure they did. But   people coming back to the labor force is encouraging.  Hill:    All right, let's get to some of the big earnings this week. The   Web Services business grew 45%, but Wall Street seemed otherwise   unimpressed with Amazon's fourth-quarter report. Shares falling a   bit on Friday, Jason.  Moser:    Wall Street is very hard to please sometimes, Chris.  Gross:    A fickle bunch.  Moser:    You see it time and time again. The reason I think Wall Street is   proceeding with a little bit of caution -- the important thing to   remember with Amazon is the metric that ultimately matters for   this business: simple top-line revenue. That's the fuel that   really keeps this engine humming. From that perspective, the   company is performing well. First-quarter projections for   management were perhaps a little bit lighter than what Wall   Street was expecting. When you have that, along with the fact   that now we're expecting them to hit another stage of investing   in the business to build out this infrastructure, it's   understandable if there's a little bit of trepidation out there.   But this is the same great business that we knew even a week   ago. Perhaps there are some concerns there in regard to India.   They've been making a lot of investments there recently. But   there were some changes to the e-commerce legislation there,   essentially tantamount to antitrust concerns that might make it a   little bit more difficult for not only Amazon, but Flipkart as   well, which is owned by   Walmart    . All in all, though, it's still the same business, taking that   same long-term approach. Amazon Web Services, as you mentioned,   doing really well. Trailing-12-month sales now of almost $26   billion. Operating income for the quarter up 57%. It's really   just a matter of, are you willing to take that patient long-term   approach with this company? I recommend that you do. I know I   am.  Gross:    Yeah, and let's not forget, all those investments take a chunk   out of the bottom line. While they're profitable to the tune of a   few billion dollars, they could be significantly more profitable   if they turn that investment spigot off. They choose to build for   the future. I think that's a smart move. Bezos knows what he's   doing. He's not really that concerned about quarterly profits,   which I like. They could be more profitable if they wanted to be   right now, but they're playing the long game.  Moser:    It's interesting to see how   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon are coming to this crossroads here.   Apple's always done such a good job of making money from selling   the devices. Now, they're trying to make money on us using those   devices. Amazon's philosophy has always been, ""We're going to   make money from you using our devices, not really from buying the   devices."" We're seeing these two businesses hit a little bit of a   different point of the strategy at this stage in their lives.  Hill:    This week,    Facebook shares    had their biggest post-earnings gain in three years. Facebook up   12% on Thursday after fourth-quarter profit came in higher than   expected, Andy.  Cross:    Hoo, and they needed it! 2018 was a tough year for Facebook. This   was the quarter that Mark Zuckerberg really needed. Revenue was   up 30% to just shy of $17 billion. Now, the growth rate actually   was trending down over the past couple of quarters, but still,   mobile ad revenues up 36%, now 93% of total ad revenue. Very   interesting [average] revenue per user at $7.37. That's up 19%   year over year. Seven million advertisers across the   platform. The message for me is that Facebook is still relevant, with   2.3 billion monthly active users on the platform. Still relevant.   Obviously, they have some challenges with privacy issues, trust   issues, but a lot of advertising flocking to get access to those   billion users on a monthly basis. Continue to show impressive   growth on the top line for Facebook.  Moser:    Yeah, really in line with what we've been saying for a while. All   these concerns aside, it's really difficult to imagine an   investor not making money in this stock, simply because of the   size of the business and the size of its user base. I found this   really interesting, they're going to essentially stop reporting   all this granular user data and just start talking about users as   a family, with Instagram and WhatsApp and Messenger and Facebook.   I think it's a bit of a cop-out, honestly, because we're not   going to get clarity as to how monetizable WhatsApp is. It sure   feels like they paid way too much for that business, and we're   never really going to find out if they're generating the return   on it. But they can do that. You have to at least admire   that.  Hill: Microsoft    's (NASDAQ: MSFT) second-quarter profits came in higher than   expected, but shares [are] falling a bit this week due to   concerns over Microsoft's cloud business slowing down. Ron, when   we talk about Microsoft, it's always about the cloud. What's   happening here?  Gross:    This was not their best quarter, but I'm a Microsoft bull. Two   things going on here. As you said, cloud business growth slowing   down, but still up 76% for the quarter. But as that business gets   larger, just the way the math works, the growth is going to slow   down. It's almost inevitable. But still, a very strong   business. The other thing that investors were focused on is that the   Windows operating system business was troubled due to the   shortage of computer chips out there, largely because of   Intel    not anticipating the proper growth and putting production in   place to meet that demand. Supplies of chips [were] lacking; that   hurt the business. That had a flow-through effect. Still, I think this is an overall strong quarter. I wouldn't   be surprised to see that shortfall of chips continue into the   first half of 2019. But, again, short-term problem, I think.   Business continues to execute. Satya Nadella has done a great job   turning this into a cloud business.  Hill:    Well, and when we just look at the stocks, and we talk about the   big tech stocks pulling back from their highs, Microsoft is   really not in the same boat as the others that we've been talking   about. You look at Facebook, you look at Amazon, Apple, which   we'll talk about in a second, those stocks are down double   digits, 20%, 25% from their highs. Microsoft is still pretty   close to its 52-week high.  Gross:    Yeah, up 8% over the last whole year. That's pretty good. And as   you said, didn't nearly take the hit as the others. It's a   fundamentally sound business with strong profits and a strong   balance sheet.  Hill:    Shares of Apple down from its 52-week high, but bouncing back   this week after first-quarter results came in higher than   expected. Andy, it seems like, not that we're market-timers here   at The Motley Fool, but when they came out earlier in January   with their warning, and the stock fell, in hindsight, that looked   like a really good time to buy shares of Apple.  Cross:    I think so. Same thing we saw with Facebook. A little bit of,   ""wow, it could have been a lot worse."" Or maybe investors were   expecting that. Now, both revenues and operating profits were   down for the holiday period for the first time in more than a   decade. But it's still an amazing business. The real struggle   they're having now is, the iPhone business is slowing. Tim Cook   wants you to think, ""Now we're building a services business over   at Apple,"" and focus more on the services. Services revenue was   up 19% this quarter. Services, good; China concerns, iPhone   concerns, not so good at Apple.  Hill:    Am I the only one who looks at these comments from Cook -- you   touched on this as well, Jason -- they're moving maybe not away   from the iPhone, but they're trying to really build up the   services business so it becomes more important to the bottom   line. Because of that, I don't see how Apple avoids getting into   video programming in a much bigger way than they are right now,   whether they make a bid for live sports, they start getting into   their own type of movie production in a bigger way, in the way   that we've seen with Amazon and   Netflix    . I don't know how they have all that cash and don't put it to   use. If you really want to ramp up your services, that could be a   key piece to it.  Moser:    They're putting together video content as we speak. That's   something that's going to appear more and more on their platform.   I don't know that I necessarily look at that as the biggest   market opportunity out there for them today. When I think about a   services business in relation to Apple, I like payments; I think   Apple Pay has a lot of potential. Apple Pay yielded 1.8 billion   transactions, more than double from a year ago this quarter. If   they can continue to build out Apple Pay, cases to use it,   communicate with merchants why they need to be using it. And then, healthcare. Tim Cook keeps talking about how he   believes that we'll look back at Apple decades from now and feel   that the biggest impact they made was in the healthcare space.   That's perhaps the biggest market opportunity out there when you   think about it. They're making steps into that space. The   partnership with Aetna. We know that telemedicine is taking off.   There's potential there for them in that regard, as well. Video, sure, but it's going to be a collection of things, for   sure.  Hill:    Visa and MasterCard both out with quarterly reports this week.   Solid reports from both, Andy, but investors seemed more   impressed by MasterCard.  Cross:    It was a better quarter. MasterCard revenues were up 15%, and   payment volumes, gross dollar volumes on their transactions were   up 14%, a little bit lower for Visa. The impressive growth that   MasterCard continues to exhibit around the globe warranted a   little bit better reaction from investors. They saw that. When   you think about the amount of transactions and dollar volumes   going across the MasterCard platform, as well as Visa, MasterCard   just seems to be a little bit on the higher-growth side. They   bought back a lot of stock during the quarter, and they bought   back more stock during January. It's exceptionally profitable,   growing very fast. MasterCard continues to be the winner in that   space.  Hill: eBay    (NASDAQ: EBAY) has been under fire from activist investors, but   eBay's fourth-quarter profits and revenue came in higher than   expected. Ron, I like how CEO Devin Wenig said on the conference   call, basically, ""I'm not taking any questions from you about the   activists.""  Gross:    Yeah, it's interesting. Yet the activism does seem to be having   an effect. Elliott Management, two of the things they suggested   were a dividend and an accelerated buyback plan. And lo and   behold, what do we have here? We've got eBay paying a dividend   for the first time after 24 years and adding $4 billion to their   buyback program. Some shareholder-friendly action there, and I'm   OK with it because this is not necessarily a high-growth company.   We're seeing revenue up about 6%, StubHub revenue up 2%. They   added about 2 million customers, now they're at 179 million. It's   not a go-go growth company like it used to be. They can afford to   return some capital to shareholders.  Hill:    There was a good stretch of time over the last 20 to 25 years   where paying a dividend was in some ways a stigma. We talked on   this show eight years or so ago: A big question about Apple was,   ""Are they going to pay a dividend? Is that going to do something   to their growth prospects?"" eBay comes of age in the dot-com era.   They pay a dividend, nobody bats an eye. It really does seem like   this is no longer a problem.  Gross:    It's a capital allocation decision and it's on a case-by-case   basis whether that's a good decision or not. In this case, they   can afford to do that because they don't really need the cash to   plow back into the business. In fact, they're thinking about   maybe jettisoning StubHub and Classifieds, and doing things like   that, to create value based on what the activists are saying.  Hill:    For the third time in less than two years,   Tesla    (NASDAQ: TSLA) has a new chief financial officer. The revolving   door in the C-suite overshadowed the fact that Tesla posted   another quarterly profit, pushing shares higher this weekend.  Cross:    Chris, you got that right. Overshadowed a really good quarter   with deliveries at almost 91,000, up 205% from last quarter.   Revenue at $7.2 billion, up 120%. And profitable. That quarter   for Tesla was really pretty impressive. Unfortunately, the   retirement of the CFO, and now hiring as the CFO Zach Kirkhorn,   who at 34 will be one of the youngest CFOs, got a lot of the   attention. But the quarter that they announced represents a   pretty continuing process of Tesla continuing to be more and more   relevant and offer products that people want. They gave some   really nice color around Model Y and Tesla Semi coming out in the   next year or two.  Hill:    We've talked before, Jason, about Kevin Plank, the CEO at   Under Armour    (NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) , and the challenges he's faced over the   last few years in terms of keeping an executive team around him.   It really does seem like the mantle has been passed to Elon Musk.   Reuters had a story out this week that wasn't even a story, it   was really just a list of all of the executive turnover at Tesla   over the last couple of years.  Moser:    It's a valid concern. It's one of the main reasons why we had   Under Armour on hold in   Million Dollar Portfolio    for a while. You need to see signs that there is a culture there   that people want to be a part of. It was very reassuring to see,   actually, that Under Armour recently hired a new chief culture   officer. It seems like Plank is really taking this seriously.   Perhaps Elon Musk can take a couple of notes from what Kevin   Plank's been doing.  Gross:    Ain't going to happen!  Moser:    [laughs] Probably not!  Hill:    Shares of PayPal down a bit this week after fourth-quarter   profits fell 6%. Jason, they're ramping up the spending. That's   hitting their margins a little bit. I don't know. I'm a   shareholder of this company; I'm good with this report.  Moser:    I'm a shareholder as well, and I agree. I'm good with the report.   The stock sold off a little bit based on the expectations game,   but you have to completely ignore that. The fundamentals of this   business are as strong as ever. We were talking about Facebook   and how scale is such a competitive advantage. Let's talk some   big numbers here for PayPal. Total payment volume for the year,   $578 billion, up 26%. Total transactions for the year $9.9   billion, up 27%. They now have 267 million total active accounts.   Mobile total payments volume clocked in at $67 billion for the   quarter. Venmo is now driving this business. They're at a $200   million run rate. There are a lot of things going on with this business, and   they're all good. I think if you're a shareholder, you have to   look at this quarter and feel very encouraged.  Hill:    Two things there. First, as someone who uses Venmo to send money   to my college kid, we've said this before about things like   Costco    and Amazon Prime, and even Netflix. If they want to bump up the   price, I'll pay it. Venmo has some room there if they want to   start raising prices, in terms of some of their transaction fees.   They're tiny.  Moser:    That's a really good point. For the longest time, there were no   transaction fees. And really, the fees that they've introduced   are all based around that instant funding option. There's risk   that PayPal and Venmo take on with that option, but the more data   they get on those transactions, the more mitigated that risk   becomes.  Hill:    For all of the innovation that we've seen in the payment   industry, with PayPal and Venmo and   Square    and all these others, am I wrong in thinking that Visa and   MasterCard have...I hesitate to use the word ""unassailable,""   Andy, but it seems like the moats that those two businesses have   built are incredible.  Cross:    They're extensive. That's one reason also why they have returns   on equity and capital north of 50% and profit margins, some of   the highest in the   S&P 500    . You just think about the ability for them to be able to   continue to take a little bit of a lick off the ice cream cone   every transaction, continue to grow and grow, that's really good   for MasterCard. They need to continue to reinvest back into that   business. It's really small, hence why they buy back so much   stock over the years.  Gross:    To come back full circle to eBay and activism, the PayPal   discussion reminded me that it was Carl Icahn, back in the day,   that pushed to have PayPal spun off of eBay. What a tremendous   value creation that was.  Moser:    Let me just take a minute here and personally thank Carl. I   really appreciate that!  Hill:    I was just going to say, do Jason and I need to send him a box of   chocolate?  Gross:    You need to do something! __  Hill:    On Sunday night, the L.A. Rams play the New England Patriots in   Super Bowl LIII. With over 100 million people across America   expected to watch the game, companies looking to promote their   products and services to that audience will pay around $5.2   million for 30 seconds of air time. Here to help us make sense of   it all is Nat Ives, the editor of CMO Today, the marketing and   media newsletter of   The Wall Street Journal    . He joins me now from the   Journal    's newsroom. Nat, thanks for being here!  Nat Ives:    My pleasure!  Hill:    This is the most-watched TV program of the year, and it has been   for decades. Most of us watch the commercials for fun. You do   this for a living. When you watch Super Bowl commercials, what   are you watching for?  Ives:    Honestly, anything that surprises me would make me happy. I think   I might be a little bit jaded. As one who watches for a living,   they begin to show certain patterns that take some of the fun out   of it. But, a big laugh or a stirring moment is really what you   want to see as a consumer. I suppose if I was a marketer, I would   also want to see a compelling sales pitch.  Hill:    I'm glad you mentioned the sales pitch. There are ads that we all   enjoy just for fun, but it doesn't mean we're necessarily going   to rush out and buy that product. How do Super Bowl advertisers   define success?  Ives:    Unfortunately, I think a lot of them define success based on the   pop it gets in the press, and online and YouTube views, in the   days surrounding the event. Unfortunately, that wears off very   quickly. By the Wednesday after the game, nobody wants to talk   about any of this anymore. It's not always evident that you've   gotten your money's worth in terms of sales lift. It depends on   what your goals are, of course. If you're a brand that nobody's   heard of and you need to let everybody in the country know all at   once, this might be the right way to do it. You're going to need   some follow-up marketing, of course, but it's a nice way to say   hello and announce yourself. If you're a brand everybody knows   and you need to fend off upstarts, perhaps it's another way to   maintain your position. But if you're a brand that's just   introducing a funny joke and getting a week's worth of PR out of   it, you could be rightly asking yourself, ""Did I achieve   incremental sales by spending that $5.2 million?""  Hill:    I want to get to some specific companies in a minute. First, are   there one or two commercials that we should keep our eyes out   for?  Ives:    The ones that I've seen so far are not blowing me away. I like   Bud's ad about the wind power that it uses. I weirdly like   Michelob Ultra Pure Gold's ASMR [autonomous sensory meridian   response] ad. This is Zoe Kravitz whispering into a microphone   for 30 seconds. It's going to stand out in an otherwise very   noisy day. A lot of the other ones are commercials I wouldn't be   surprised to see any other day of the week.  Hill:    I was looking at a PowerPoint that   The Wall Street Journal    had put together about advertising on the Super Bowl. One of the   things that struck me was, over the last 25 years,   Anheuser-Busch    ,   Pepsi    ,   General Motors    ,   Coca-Cola    -- they're among the big public companies who have spent the most   amount of money on airtime. These are also incredibly well-known   brands, particularly in the case of Budweiser, Pepsi, and Coke.   Do you think that's money well spent?  Ives:    It takes a lot more research than I personally have done to   authoritatively answer that. But, I would say in the case of A-B,   for example, they really are defending their position as   America's brewer. They're advertising both their established   brands, Bud and Bud Light, and regularly rotating through new   brands, including a hard seltzer this year -- alcoholic sparkling   water that they're trying to get off the ground. They've got   their purpose, and that's why they're going to have 8 1/2 minutes   in the game this year, which is incredible.  Hill:    For the first time in over a decade, Coca-Cola is not advertising   during the game itself. I was a little surprised by this, in part   because of their history of spending during the Super Bowl, but   also, the game is in Atlanta. That's ground zero for Coca-Cola.   Why aren't they advertising during this game?  Ives:    Maybe Coca-Cola figured out a better way, they thought, to use   their message and timing. They've got this unity ad that says,   ""He disagrees, she disagrees, but they both drink Coke."" They're   running it right before the national anthem. It's a really   fitting spot that actually is still going to have very high   tune-in, probably cost less than the very next spot that's going   to run in the game. They'll see what they get out of it. I support the idea of marketers that are usually in sitting   out once in a while or trying something different, just to see if   they can detect an effect. If they can't, then maybe they can   save themselves $5 million every year.  Hill:    For years, Amazon did not spend a dime on TV advertising. This   year, I think it's going to be one of the biggest spenders during   the Super Bowl. Obviously,   CBS    , the network that's airing the game this year, is happy about   that. Amazon is famous for the way that they analyze data on   their website. I'm a little surprised that they're spending this   much on TV advertising because, as you indicated, it can be a   little tricky, other than just measuring buzz in media reports,   to evaluate how much a TV ad is doing for a particular product.   Are you at all surprised at the way that Amazon has jumped into   TV advertising?  Ives:    Amazon is being driven by marketing -- not its website, for   example, but its new consumer electronics product. It's trying to   sell Alexa and Alexa-powered devices. That's why you see   Alphabet    in the Super Bowl again this year as well. These guys have a   package of electronics they're trying to sell in stores and   online. They're also trying to become the default, the Coke to   the Pepsi, in the voice-assistant world. This is a wide-open   segment that's probably going to get bigger and bigger and   bigger. They've obviously made the bet that telling everyone in   America that they've got the voice assistant you want is worth   it. Amazon's 2.5 minutes in the game this year actually also   includes a trailer for its Amazon Prime streaming video service,   which is another highly competitive direct-to-consumer business   that takes a lot of spending, both on the content and the   marketing, to win.  Hill:    Another big tech company that has a relatively new consumer   device is Facebook with their Portal device. Unless I missed   something, I don't think Facebook is advertising during the Super   Bowl. I'm curious -- particularly in the wake of 2018, which was   a year of consistently bad publicity for Facebook -- how is   Facebook regarded in the advertising community right now?  Ives:    Their recent ads, to your point, have been for Portal, and to   say, ""We're sorry, we're going to do better."" That's what they've   been on TV for in 2018. And they did a lot of Portal ads in the   holiday season. I wouldn't have been particularly surprised to   see them advertising in the Super Bowl here. That they're not may   reflect some business considerations. It may reflect, now that   the holiday season is over, the calculation that it's better to   get out of the spotlight for a second and try to clear up their   brand.  Hill:    I mentioned at the top that the price of 30 seconds of ad time   during the game is $5.2 million. If that's higher than last year,   it's only incrementally higher. I'm curious if you have any   insight into CBS. Obviously, they're making a lot of money off   this game; they're charging $5.2 million for 30 seconds. But   they've also turned down some advertising. Most famously, there   was a medical-marijuana company that wanted to buy a 30-second   ad, and CBS turned them down. Why is that?  Ives:    CBS and the NFL both are going to be very careful with their   image and the image of the Super Bowl. This is considered a   secular holiday. This is considered a game for the entire country   to watch. You're not going to find anything that's terribly   risque or off-color in this year's game. There's certainly ads   that have aired in decades past that we would probably consider   offensive now, and it would generate a lot of media coverage. But   you're not going to see weed in any form advertised in an NFL   property anytime soon. The NFL just got around to letting liquor   into NFL games. This year, even liquor is not allowed in the   Super Bowl, so cannabis is beyond the pale for these guys.   They're trying to remain looking as squeaky-clean as they can.   The NFL, too, has plenty of controversy to deal with; they don't   need new headaches.  Hill:    All right, last question, then I'll let you go. Separate from the   Super Bowl, just when it comes to advertising writ large in 2019,   what's something that you're watching this year? It can be a   trend, it can be a particular company. What's something that's on   your radar in the advertising and marketing industry?  Ives:    I'm always keeping an eye on the balance between ad-supported   media and media that, one way or another, lets consumers stay   away from advertising. For example, Netflix versus ad-supported   Hulu versus an ad-free version of YouTube. There are all kinds of   new streaming services coming along, and of course, there are the   ad blockers online. The ability of marketers to reach consumers   in any sort of normal, recognizable way is being constrained.   Seeing what channels remain and what new ones come along is   fascinating. Everything else outside of that is asking a   completely different skill set for marketers, and that's creating   content that people actually want to see.

Thanks for taking a few minutes   and enjoy the game!  Ives:    Thanks for having me! You too! __  Hill:    Our email address is   radio@fool.com    . With the big game on Sunday, this is a very timely email from   Bill Davis. He writes, ""There was a great    New York Times     article this week about the huge growth coming in sports   gambling, based on recent legal changes and attitudes and   outlooks in the sports culture. Can you talk some about this   expanding market opportunity and maybe suggest a basket of stocks   in this area?"" Jason, we've talked about a war-on-cash basket,   the health-and-wellness basket. Is there a sports-gambling   basket?  Moser:    [laughs] I want to approach this from the perspective -- I'm not   a big gambler, so it's hard for me to actually see where the   competitive advantage lies in any one particular entity. Where I   do feel like there's an advantage is, no matter what, that money   has to go from point A to point B. I've talked often about how   with this move, all of these payments providers have an   opportunity to make some money from this market. The war-on-cash   basket certainly applies there to a degree. I'm also going to push Bill over to a recent episode of   Industry Focus    : Jan. 15, Nick and Asit did a whole show on casino stocks and   sports gambling; it's like an hour long. They really dug into a   lot of that stuff. I would encourage him to go back there, listen   to the Jan. 15 episode of   Industry Focus    .  Hill:    Ron?  Gross:    Bill, because I care about you and our listeners, I did a little   research here. These are not recommendations, but the main   players here you want to check out:   The Stars Group    ,   William Hill    ,   Boyd Gaming    . If you're a fan of the FanDuel-type companies,   Paddy Power Betfair    out of Britain actually acquired FanDuel, so that would be a way   to play that.  Hill:    William Hill, no relation.  Gross:    No?  Hill:    [laughs] Before we get to the stocks on our radar, any prop bets   for the game of interest to you guys? The one that always gets me   is the over-under on the singing of the national anthem. Like   you, Jason, I'm not a big gambler, but I look at that and think,   ""Gosh, that seems like the easiest thing in the world to   fix.""  Moser:    Yeah, and it's usually really great fodder for the Stern show   that following Monday. They always have fun with that, and then   juxtaposing it with Robin's efforts at the national anthem one   time ago.  Gross:    It's funny stuff. You can bet this year and most years on the   color of Gatorade that will be poured over the winning team's   coach. It seems like you could get a little inside info on that,   too.  Hill:    Absolutely. I'm happy to share some news, really the best kind of   news. Earlier this week, our friend and colleague Matt   Argersinger became a father. [all applaud]  Moser:    Hey, congratulations, Matty!  Hill:    His wife gave birth to a healthy baby boy. I'm sure Matt did a   great job standing next to her in the hospital while she did all   the work. Everyone's doing well. We could not be happier in part   because all of us around this table, and also behind the glass,   we are all fathers. We all know just how sleep-deprived Matt's   going to be for the next year or so. With that in mind, we've got a very special stock on our radar   this week: It's stocks for baby Argersinger. Not that Matt is not   a great investor; he is. But we're going to offer up some ideas   for this baby boy. We'll be conservative in our time line,   because look, you know what this kid has ahead of him? Many more   decades of investing than we have.  Cross:    A lot of time!  Hill:    We'll put together some ideas for when he turns 20 years old. So,   radar stocks for 2039. Steve Broido is not only going to suggest   a stock of his own, but he's going to pick one for the baby to   double down. We're going to have a five-stock portfolio. Ron,   you're up first.  Gross:    All right. If little baby Argersinger is going to be a snappy   dresser like his dad, I've got to go back to   Carter's    (NYSE: CRI) , CRI, the leading manufacturer of children's   clothing in the U.S. under names like Carter's and OshKosh   B'gosh. As I said, they're the dominant player here. They've   performed well over multiple market cycles, 2.2% dividend yield,   buys back a ton of stock. They're digesting the Toys R Us   bankruptcy, and there are some China trade issues here, so the   stock has suffered, but that makes it awfully cheap.  Hill:    Steve, question about Carter's?  Steve Broido:    I know Carter's stores. Is Carter's merchandise available outside   of Carter's stores?  Gross:    They make specialty collections for folks like   Target    , Walmart. They have a specialty collection for Amazon. You can   get them there.  Broido:    I'm glad you knew the answer to that one.  Hill:    Jason Moser.  Moser:    I was thinking we could probably have a recommendation for Matty   and Jean, too. They're going to have to set that coffee maker on   ""stun,"" so why not buy a few extra shares of   Starbucks    ? But for the young man, I'm going to go back to my daughters'   portfolio. The most recent addition for them -- Santa brought   them a few shares of Square. I think that's not a bad pick here,   either. You know all about that business. They're building out   the Square Financial Services side now, as they've resubmitted   their banking-license application. I think that's going to be a   really neat part of the business once they build it out. I'm   really encouraged with the things that they're doing. They're   opening up access to capital, new products and services for   customers. That'll help them build up a pretty enviable   competitive position over time. So, hey, listen, man, if you're   looking for the ultra-long term, that's probably a good   addition.  Hill:    Steve, question about Square?  Broido:    I hear the name Square all the time. I still don't really know   what they do. Help me!  Moser:    Oh, come on, Steve!  Broido:    I know that you swipe your credit card on the little thing. Is   that it?  Gross:    It's like a circle, but...  Moser:    [laughs] That's basically it. It's a hardware company that's   developed a very robust ecosystem behind that hardware. They help   businesses deal with payments, inventory management, all sorts of   things.  Hill:    Andy Cross?  Cross:    I'm going to stick with the advertising theme for young Mr.   Argersinger here and go with   Trade Desk    (NASDAQ: TTD) , TTD, one of the most impressive companies I've   followed over the past year. They're the masters at programmatic   trading, advertising matching with clients, and ad impressions.   On average per day, their clients -- who are mostly advertising   agencies -- have exposure to almost 600 billion ad impressions   per day. They're really helping drive the automated programmatic   trading, matching up buyers and platforms, publishers, with ad   impressions. The growth has been 50% a year for the past year or   so. Very profitable. Beautiful balance sheet. It's founder-run by   Jeff Green, who's really impressed me. I like Trade Desk for the   next 20 years.  Hill:    Steve?  Broido:    Does a company like Trade Desk work with people like Facebook? We   talked about that earlier in the show.  Cross:    Facebook and Twitter, those are closed, walled-off gardens.   They're all on their own. Trade Desk helps all the publishers and   ad buyers out there outside of some of those walled gardens.  Hill:    So, that's three stocks for the portfolio. Steve, you get to   essentially pick one to double down on. And then, if you have one   of your own, that would be great!  Broido:    I think Square. I'm hearing the war on cash. That'd be   terrific.  Moser:    Hey, now!  Broido:    In terms of my stock, I see the future, Ron Gross: It is round,   it is filled with tires. It is   Titan International    (NYSE: TWI) . [all laugh]  Gross:    Oh, my goodness!  Broido:    Coming full circle.  Gross:    Awesome!  Hill:    I want to go back to something you mentioned.  Gross:    TWI.  Hill:    You mentioned Starbucks. I was looking at this -- and I'm a happy   Starbucks shareholder -- the market cap of Starbucks is $85   billion, whereas   Dunkin' Brands    is $5 billion. So, just in terms of growth opportunities, Matt   Argersinger, a proud son of Massachusetts: I kind of feel like   maybe Dunkin' Brands, at least in terms of the next 20 years, a   better growth opportunity.  Moser:    Perhaps.  Hill:    It doesn't really have the footprint right now, certainly not   outside of New England.  Moser:    Perhaps. But with all of his New England loyalties, I always see   a Starbucks cup on his desk! Explain that!  Hill:    That's fair. That's fair.  Gross:    He's going to love watching that game this weekend with his boy.   That'll be great!  Hill:    As Jason said, hopefully he's got a lot of coffee.

Chris Hill:    It's the   Motley Fool Money    radio show.
I'm Chris Hill.
Joining me in studio, senior analysts   Jason Moser, Andy Cross, and Ron Gross.
We will dig into the business of Super Bowl   ads.
We've been talking a lot about how the   interest-rate environment we've been expecting would potentially   offer these banks a bit more of an opportunity at profitability.
But if rates are going to hang where they are, or perhaps even go   down -- which is amazing to think about, still -- that may delay   a little bit of what these banks may be able to do.
Andy Cross:    I think Ron's right, with the Fed being a little bit more   important here, but that employment number was pretty impressive.
Hill:    All right, let's get to some of the big earnings this week.
The   Web Services business grew 45%, but Wall Street seemed otherwise   unimpressed with Amazon's fourth-quarter report.
The reason I think Wall Street is   proceeding with a little bit of caution -- the important thing to   remember with Amazon is the metric that ultimately matters for   this business: simple top-line revenue.
Amazon's philosophy has always been, ""We're going to   make money from you using our devices, not really from buying the   devices."" We're seeing these two businesses hit a little bit of a   different point of the strategy at this stage in their lives.
Hill:    This week,    Facebook shares    had their biggest post-earnings gain in three years.
All   these concerns aside, it's really difficult to imagine an   investor not making money in this stock, simply because of the   size of the business and the size of its user base.
It sure   feels like they paid way too much for that business, and we're   never really going to find out if they're generating the return   on it.
Hill: Microsoft    's (NASDAQ: MSFT) second-quarter profits came in higher than   expected, but shares [are] falling a bit this week due to   concerns over Microsoft's cloud business slowing down.
Gross:    This was not their best quarter, but I'm a Microsoft bull.
But as that business gets   larger, just the way the math works, the growth is going to slow   down.
Hill:    Well, and when we just look at the stocks, and we talk about the   big tech stocks pulling back from their highs, Microsoft is   really not in the same boat as the others that we've been talking   about.
You look at Facebook, you look at Amazon, Apple, which   we'll talk about in a second, those stocks are down double   digits, 20%, 25% from their highs.
Hill:    Shares of Apple down from its 52-week high, but bouncing back   this week after first-quarter results came in higher than   expected.
Andy, it seems like, not that we're market-timers here   at The Motley Fool, but when they came out earlier in January   with their warning, and the stock fell, in hindsight, that looked   like a really good time to buy shares of Apple.
Tim Cook   wants you to think, ""Now we're building a services business over   at Apple,"" and focus more on the services.
Hill:    Am I the only one who looks at these comments from Cook -- you   touched on this as well, Jason -- they're moving maybe not away   from the iPhone, but they're trying to really build up the   services business so it becomes more important to the bottom   line.
Because of that, I don't see how Apple avoids getting into   video programming in a much bigger way than they are right now,   whether they make a bid for live sports, they start getting into   their own type of movie production in a bigger way, in the way   that we've seen with Amazon and   Netflix    .
When I think about a   services business in relation to Apple, I like payments; I think   Apple Pay has a lot of potential.
Apple Pay yielded 1.8 billion   transactions, more than double from a year ago this quarter.
Hill:    Visa and MasterCard both out with quarterly reports this week.
MasterCard revenues were up 15%, and   payment volumes, gross dollar volumes on their transactions were   up 14%, a little bit lower for Visa.
When   you think about the amount of transactions and dollar volumes   going across the MasterCard platform, as well as Visa, MasterCard   just seems to be a little bit on the higher-growth side.
Hill: eBay    (NASDAQ: EBAY) has been under fire from activist investors, but   eBay's fourth-quarter profits and revenue came in higher than   expected.
Ron, I like how CEO Devin Wenig said on the conference   call, basically, ""I'm not taking any questions from you about the   activists.""  Gross:    Yeah, it's interesting.
We've got eBay paying a dividend   for the first time after 24 years and adding $4 billion to their   buyback program.
Hill:    There was a good stretch of time over the last 20 to 25 years   where paying a dividend was in some ways a stigma.
We talked on   this show eight years or so ago: A big question about Apple was,   ""Are they going to pay a dividend?
Hill:    For the third time in less than two years,   Tesla    (NASDAQ: TSLA) has a new chief financial officer.
Hill:    We've talked before, Jason, about Kevin Plank, the CEO at   Under Armour    (NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) , and the challenges he's faced over the   last few years in terms of keeping an executive team around him.
Hill:    Shares of PayPal down a bit this week after fourth-quarter   profits fell 6%.
Let's talk some   big numbers here for PayPal. Total payment volume for the year,   $578 billion, up 26%.
There are a lot of things going on with this business, and   they're all good.
Hill:    Two things there.
First, as someone who uses Venmo to send money   to my college kid, we've said this before about things like   Costco    and Amazon Prime, and even Netflix.
Hill:    For all of the innovation that we've seen in the payment   industry, with PayPal and Venmo and   Square    and all these others, am I wrong in thinking that Visa and   MasterCard have...I hesitate to use the word ""unassailable,""   Andy, but it seems like the moats that those two businesses have   built are incredible.
You just think about the ability for them to be able to   continue to take a little bit of a lick off the ice cream cone   every transaction, continue to grow and grow, that's really good   for MasterCard.
Hill:    I was just going to say, do Jason and I need to send him a box of   chocolate?
With over 100 million people across America   expected to watch the game, companies looking to promote their   products and services to that audience will pay around $5.2   million for 30 seconds of air time.
Hill:    This is the most-watched TV program of the year, and it has been   for decades.
You're going to need   some follow-up marketing, of course, but it's a nice way to say   hello and announce yourself.
But if you're a brand that's just   introducing a funny joke and getting a week's worth of PR out of   it, you could be rightly asking yourself, ""Did I achieve   incremental sales by spending that $5.2 million?""  Hill:    I want to get to some specific companies in a minute.
Hill:    I was looking at a PowerPoint that   The Wall Street Journal    had put together about advertising on the Super Bowl.
They've got   their purpose, and that's why they're going to have 8 1/2 minutes   in the game this year, which is incredible.
Hill:    For the first time in over a decade, Coca-Cola is not advertising   during the game itself.
Hill:    For years, Amazon did not spend a dime on TV advertising.
This   year, I think it's going to be one of the biggest spenders during   the Super Bowl.
I'm a little surprised that they're spending this   much on TV advertising because, as you indicated, it can be a   little tricky, other than just measuring buzz in media reports,   to evaluate how much a TV ad is doing for a particular product.
Amazon's 2.5 minutes in the game this year actually also   includes a trailer for its Amazon Prime streaming video service,   which is another highly competitive direct-to-consumer business   that takes a lot of spending, both on the content and the   marketing, to win.
Hill:    Another big tech company that has a relatively new consumer   device is Facebook with their Portal device.
Unless I missed   something, I don't think Facebook is advertising during the Super   Bowl.
I'm curious -- particularly in the wake of 2018, which was   a year of consistently bad publicity for Facebook -- how is   Facebook regarded in the advertising community right now?
Ives:    Their recent ads, to your point, have been for Portal, and to   say, ""We're sorry, we're going to do better."" That's what they've   been on TV for in 2018.
Hill:    I mentioned at the top that the price of 30 seconds of ad time   during the game is $5.2 million.
You're not going to find anything that's terribly   risque or off-color in this year's game.
Hill:    All right, last question, then I'll let you go.
Separate from the   Super Bowl, just when it comes to advertising writ large in 2019,   what's something that you're watching this year?
Ives:    I'm always keeping an eye on the balance between ad-supported   media and media that, one way or another, lets consumers stay   away from advertising.
Hill:    If you want to know which businesses are making headlines for   their marketing spends, you can follow Nat Ives on   Twitter    .
Nat, I know it's a busy week.
Can you talk some about this   expanding market opportunity and maybe suggest a basket of stocks   in this area?"" Jason, we've talked about a war-on-cash basket,   the health-and-wellness basket.
Moser:    [laughs] I want to approach this from the perspective -- I'm not   a big gambler, so it's hard for me to actually see where the   competitive advantage lies in any one particular entity.
I've talked often about how   with this move, all of these payments providers have an   opportunity to make some money from this market.
I'm also going to push Bill over to a recent episode of   Industry Focus    : Jan. 15, Nick and Asit did a whole show on casino stocks and   sports gambling; it's like an hour long.
Hill:    [laughs] Before we get to the stocks on our radar, any prop bets   for the game of interest to you guys?
Like   you, Jason, I'm not a big gambler, but I look at that and think,   ""Gosh, that seems like the easiest thing in the world to   fix.""  Moser:    Yeah, and it's usually really great fodder for the Stern show   that following Monday.
We all know just how sleep-deprived Matt's   going to be for the next year or so.
Hill:    We'll put together some ideas for when he turns 20 years old.
If little baby Argersinger is going to be a snappy   dresser like his dad, I've got to go back to   Carter's    (NYSE: CRI) , CRI, the leading manufacturer of children's   clothing in the U.S. under names like Carter's and OshKosh   B'gosh.
Hill:    Jason Moser.
I think that's going to be a   really neat part of the business once they build it out.
Cross:    I'm going to stick with the advertising theme for young Mr.
Argersinger here and go with   Trade Desk    (NASDAQ: TTD) , TTD, one of the most impressive companies I've   followed over the past year.
Hill:    So, that's three stocks for the portfolio.
So, just in terms of growth opportunities, Matt   Argersinger, a proud son of Massachusetts: I kind of feel like   maybe Dunkin' Brands, at least in terms of the next 20 years, a   better growth opportunity.
Gross:    He's going to love watching that game this weekend with his boy.
Hill:    As Jason said, hopefully he's got a lot of coffee.

59,"February 05, 2019, 09:03:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,3 Things Investors Need to Know About Apple's Rumored TV Service,"
 It's an open secret that   Apple    's (NASDAQ: AAPL) working on a video subscription service. While   the company hasn't officially announced anything just yet, Apple   CEO Tim Cook continues to tease the service, and said on the most   recent       earnings call    , ""We will participate in the original content world. We have   signed a multiyear partnership with Oprah. But today, I'm not   really ready to extend that conversation beyond that point."" Cook has already said that his company will launch new   services this year, and there's way too much smoke around an   Apple video service for there not to be a fire at this point. Apple is expected to lean more on services revenue in the near   future to make up for   slowing iPhone sales    , which means that investors need to pay close attention to any   new services that could help offset iPhone revenue declines. With   that in mind, here are three key things investors should know   about Apple's rumored TV service.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Apple.  1. Apple's creating $4 billion worth of original content and   will offer subscriptions to other content, too While some talk about how Apple's TV subscription service   compares to   Netflix    , the rumored service may function more like   Amazon    's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Video service. Prime Video comes with   Amazon's $119 per year subscription and gives its users access to   licensed video content, original shows and movies created by   Amazon, and the ability to subscribe to premium channels, like   HBO, within the service. Apple's TV service is expected to function similarly, with   Apple spending $1 billion in 2018 -- and $4 billion over the next   three years -- for original programming, while also letting users   subscribe to premium channels within its service. With that level of spending on original shows, it's clear that   Apple wants its own content to be a core benefit of the service.   To do that, the company is working on a new TV series with Oprah   Winfrey and hired big-name directors including Steven Spielberg,   M. Night Shyamalan, and   LaLa Land    's Damien Chazelle. The content options will run the gamut of   science fiction shows, thrillers, children's programming, and   animated content. Apple will reportedly use the Apple TV app that comes standard   on iPhones and iPads to connect users to all of this programming.   But there's evidence Apple could bring the app to hardware   outside of the Apple world as well. The company   recently launched its iTunes app    on   Samsung    , LG, and Vizio smart TVs. This move indicates that Apple is open   to running some of its services, including a new TV service, on   hardware other than Apple products. 2. Apple could launch its TV service as early as April Apple wants to debut its TV service in March and officially   bring it online in April, according to a   report    in   The Wall Street Journal    . This makes some sense considering that Apple typically holds an   event in March, and the company could use some of its stage time   to talk about the new service. Apple's TV subscription is   expected to be offered in the U.S. first and roll out to other   countries after that. This time frame has an asterisk next to it, though, as Apple   is reportedly still working on its original programming, and some   of it may not be ready in time. The   WSJ    article noted that some content producers familiar with Apple's   rumored TV service say that the date could be pushed back. What   is    likely is that Apple will launch its TV subscription service this   year. Cook said last month that the company would introduce new   services this year, and if Apple were to wait beyond 2019, it   might be too late for the company to make a dent in this   fast-growing market.   Image source: Apple.  3. Apple is a serious underdog in this space Even if Apple does launch a TV streaming service in the next   few months and spends billions of dollars over the next few years   on content, there's still no guarantee that it will be a   success. Apple is late to the video content market and will be fighting   to grab viewers' attention away from   Netflix    , Amazon Video, Hulu, HBO, etc. It also will face even more   competition when   Disney    launches its video streaming service   later this year    . Since Apple is so late to this content game, it's hard to make   a strong case for why the company will beat its rivals. Amazon   already has award-winning shows, a growing catalog of original   content, strong licensing agreements for third-party content,   popular hardware through its Fire TV devices, and more than   26 million U.S. customers    who already have access to its video service. Of course, Apple was slow to adapt to the streaming music   market and now has   50 million paying subscribers    ; it's also now a serious competitor to Spotify. But Apple at   least had a long history of music successes in the past that it   built off of -- it doesn't have the same with video. Additionally, the company's Apple TV device is far from a   success in the streaming device market --   Roku    and Amazon   essentially own the space    . Apple usually succeeds when it sells people a popular device   (i.e., iPhone) and then makes money from additional purchases   through that device (i.e., app store purchases). With its new TV   service, the company is missing the first key ingredient of its   past success because the Apple TV isn't a popular device. Nowhere else to go Apple needs more revenue growth to make up for slipping iPhone   sales, and it's increasingly looking to services to be one of its   next biggest revenue drivers. Whether a video streaming service   is the way to go remains to be seen, but investors should be   cautious about betting on a smash hit for Apple in the video   market. The company is moving timidly into video content, and   it's already a highly competitive and increasingly crowded   market.   10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple's TV service is expected to function similarly, with   Apple spending $1 billion in 2018 -- and $4 billion over the next   three years -- for original programming, while also letting users   subscribe to premium channels within its service.
The company   recently launched its iTunes app    on   Samsung    , LG, and Vizio smart TVs. This move indicates that Apple is open   to running some of its services, including a new TV service, on   hardware other than Apple products.
What   is    likely is that Apple will launch its TV subscription service this   year.
Cook said last month that the company would introduce new   services this year, and if Apple were to wait beyond 2019, it   might be too late for the company to make a dent in this   fast-growing market.
3. Apple is a serious underdog in this space Even if Apple does launch a TV streaming service in the next   few months and spends billions of dollars over the next few years   on content, there's still no guarantee that it will be a   success.
With its new TV   service, the company is missing the first key ingredient of its   past success because the Apple TV isn't a popular device.",1,0.4956461538461539
60,"February 05, 2019, 07:10:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,"Breaking Down Disney's Q1 Earnings, Streaming Revenue, ESPN & More","
 Disney DIS  reported better-than-expected Q1 fiscal 2019 financial results after the closing bell Tuesday. These results, however, marked downturns from the first quarter of 2018. Still, Wall Street was likely more intrigued to see how Disney's newly revamped business units performed as the company prepares to enter the streaming TV age and take on Netflix NFLX  and Amazon AMZN  .  Q1 Overview  Disney's revenues came in slightly lower than the year-ago period's $15.351 billion at $15.303 billion. This fell well below Q4 2018's 12% top-line expansion but managed to top our $15.18 billion Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, the company reported adjusted EPS of $1.84, which marked a 3% decline from the year-ago period, yet crushed our $1.57 a share estimate that would have represented a nearly 17% downturn. With that covered, it's time to see how Disney's key business units performed. But before we dive into this, investors should note the media powerhouse changed its core four business units as it enters a new streaming-focused phase.   Direct-to-Consumer & International is one of Disney's two new divisions, and it will be closely watched for years to come. Interactive Media was previously grouped together with Consumer Products, which is now joined together with Parks and Resorts to form the Parks, Experiences & Consumer Products unit. Clearly, this makes year-over-year results harder to compare this quarter and for the rest of 2019, but it was necessary for Disney to make the change.     Unit Revenue  Disney's Media Networks division revenue climbed 7% to $5.921 billion. But as we mentioned, the prior-year quarter's results have been changed to reflect the new division breakdowns. More specifically, Cable Networks revenue jumped 4%. However, Disney's closely-watched ESPN division saw its operating income fall based on higher programming costs. Meanwhile, Broadcasting revenues popped 12%. Moving on, Disney's new Parks, Experiences & Consumer Products division's revenues jumped 5% to $6.824 billion. Studio Entertainment saw its revenues plummet 27% to touch $1.824 billion. This isn't that shocking for a unit that is prone to massive quarterly swings and big surprises, in either direction, based on the nature of movie release schedules and box office hits. Lastly, Disney's newly formed, streaming-focused Direct-to-Consumer & International unit revenues fell 1% to $918 million. More importantly, the segment's operating loss soared from $42 million in the prior-year quarter to $136 million. Significant investment increases at ESPN+, which was launched in April 2018, and costs related to Disney+ helped account for the much larger operating loss.  Bottom Line   Disney stock  climbed 0.77% to $112.66 a share during regular trading hours Tuesday. DIS stock didn't make any major moves in either direction after-hours and hovered down roughly 5% from its 52-week high. For now, investors are likely waiting to see how Disney's new stand-alone streaming service, which is due out this year, does against Netflix, Amazon, and eventually AT&T T  , Apple AAPL  , and many others. Wall Street might also focus on costs as the firm spends heavily to roll out its new Disney+ streaming service complete with new original TV shows-and eventually Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA  offerings.

61,"February 05, 2019, 06:18:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,It Could Be Too Late for Apple's HomePod,"
  Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) often says that it doesn't care about being the   first player in a new market, as long as it can become the best   once it gets there. But that's little consolation when it comes   to markets where competing platforms are able to lock consumers   in, such as the booming smart speaker market. Apple only entered   the smart speaker space last year with the HomePod, which   hasn't sold well    due to its high price tag and limited support of third-party   music-streaming services. Two fresh research reports help illustrate the uphill battle   that the Mac maker now faces.   Amazon's affordable Echo Dot is a hit. Image source:     Amazon.makeArticleAd();  Smart speaker owners are incredibly loyal Market researcher Park Associates has   released a study today    that shows 97% of smart speaker households have just one brand of   smart speaker, suggesting that consumers are very loyal to brands   and generally stick to the platform they initially invest in.   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) and   Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google have already   established strong footholds in the market, thanks in large part   to the affordable Echo Dot and Google Home Mini, both of which   cost around $50. Smart speaker   adoption soared in 2018    , and expanding into a household with multiple devices is   low-hanging fruit for vendors. ""Smart speaker owners are   increasingly adopting multiple devices in various rooms of the   household,"" Park Associates senior analyst Kristen Hanich said in   a statement. ""Device makers can leverage this tendency toward   repeat and extra purchases to bundle new and premium products   with smart speaker sales."" Park Associates estimates that two-thirds of U.S. households   have an Echo, with nearly a third owning a Google Home. A second opinion Separately, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP)   also put out new estimates today. The U.S. installed base of   smart speakers has now reached 66 million, up from 53 million in   the third quarter, according to the report. CIRP's data, which is   derived from a survey of 500 U.S. consumers, differs slightly   from Park Associates. CIRP estimates that Amazon represents 70% of the installed   base, followed by Google at 24%. Apple's HomePod has grabbed just   6% of the installed base. Apple is unlikely to grow that share   until it releases a more affordable device. A ""   HomePod Mini    "" is reportedly in the works, but is expected to cost around $150   to $200 -- still priced at a noticeable premium compared to the   competition. ""Amazon and Google both have broad model lineups, ranging from   basic to high-end, with even more variants from Amazon,"" said   CIRP co-founder Josh Lowitz. ""Apple of course has only its   premium-priced HomePod, and likely won't gain significant share   until it offers an entry-level product closer to Echo Dot and   Home mini."" The longer that Apple waits to release an affordable HomePod   Mini, the greater its challenge will be, as Amazon and Google   only continue to gain momentum.   10 stocks we like better than Apple       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

62,"February 05, 2019, 05:27:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,It's Official: Amazon Considers Its Shipping Partners Competitors,"
  Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) and its shipping partners   FedEx    (NYSE: FDX) and   UPS    (NYSE: UPS) continue to downplay how much they compete with each   other, even in the face of indisputable evidence that Amazon is   trying to   poach shipping business    from third-party merchants on its platform. FedEx CEO Fred Smith   said that FedEx doesn't see Amazon ""as a peer competitor at this   point in time"" last year, for instance. Meanwhile, UPS CEO David   Abney at long last admitted the competitive threat that Amazon   poses in an interview with Business Insider last week. However, Amazon for the first time ever has just   indirectly acknowledged that those shipping partners are indeed   competitors.   Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();  Amazon now competes in ""transportation and logistics   services"" Amazon filed its annual report 10-K with the SEC last   week and noted intense competition in many of the markets where   it competes. Some of the areas -- such as e-commerce, omnichannel   retail, and digital content -- have long been mentioned in   regulatory filings. But there was a new addition: ""transportation   and logistics services."" The new language is similar to the   company's 2017 10-K, in which it referenced ""companies that   provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for   third parties"" in a list of ""current and potential   competitors."" Just last month, Amazon inked a new deal with   Air Transport Services Group    to lease an additional 10 aircraft as part of its growing   in-house logistics network, dubbed Amazon Air. As part of that   partnership, Amazon has warrants that give it the right to   acquire a 33% stake in transportation provider, suggesting that   Amazon may look to buy the company at some point in the   future. As Amazon continues to grow, so do its shipping costs, which   jumped nearly 30% in 2018.     Year   Shipping Costs       2015   $11.5 billion     2016   $16.2 billion     2017   $21.7 billion     2018   $27.7 billion     Data source: SEC filings. Shipping remains one of Amazon's biggest line items,   representing nearly 20% of cost of sales last year. Bringing more   shipping in-house will help keep those expenses in check,   although the company remains coy in how it officially describes   its efforts. ""We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in   part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our   fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers,   and achieving better operating efficiencies,"" Amazon writes in   its filings. Note that the company's reported shipping costs   include when it acts as its own transportation service   provider. On the   earnings call    last week, CFO Brian Olsavsky continued to frame Amazon Air's   expansion as a supplement to its current partners' capacity. ""We   have great [transportation] partners in place for our business   and support globally,"" Olsavsky said. ""What we do is add capacity   where we feel we need to speed up service or ensure demand,   particularly at peak."" That may be true in the short term, but the trajectory of   Amazon's ongoing expansion should concern its shipping partners   in the long term.

ABC and parks boost Disney profit above forecasts


By Lisa Richwine and Vibhuti Sharma
Feb 5 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co  reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday that handily topped Wall Street estimates thanks to a booming theme park business and growth at its ABC broadcast network as the company invests in a digital media future.
Shares of Disney rose 1.8 percent to $114.70 in after-hours trading.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
By saving content for its own platforms, Disney estimates a decrease in year-over-year operating income of $150 million this fiscal year because it will forego licensing revenue from others, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said on a conference call.
Disney has reorganized its divisions for its streaming future, and Tuesday's earnings report was the first to reflect the company's new structure.
Operating income at the media networks unit, Disney's largest, rose 7 percent from a year earlier to $1.3 billion. The ABC broadcast division saw profit jump 40 percent thanks to growth in affiliate fees, advertising revenue and program sales.
The theme parks and consumer products division reported profit of $2.2 billion, up 10 percent from a year earlier. Results were buoyed by increased guest spending and higher occupancy rates at Disney's U.S. theme parks.
""Disney's earnings momentum shows that the company will be entering a highly competitive video-streaming market from a position of strength,"" said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com.
""If its existing media assets are churning out good cash and it's able to contain its costs, the video streaming push later this year should make investors excited and help the stock to get out of its current sluggish spell,"" he said.
The ESPN+ streaming service has signed up 2 million paying subscribers, Disney's chief executive, Bob Iger, said on the conference call. That is double the number five months ago. Nearly 600,000 of those new customers joined ahead of the service's first UFC Fight Night mixed-martial arts contest, Iger said.
Overall, Disney's adjusted earnings-per-share declined 3 percent for the quarter from a year earlier as profit fell at the company's movie studio.
Profit at the movie studio plunged 63 percent to $309 million as films including ""Mary Poppins Returns"" could not match the strong lineup of a year earlier, which included ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi.""
A new division, direct-to-consumer and international, reported a $136 million loss for the quarter. That included spending to set up Disney+, a streaming service for family entertainment that the company plans to debut later this year.
As part of that effort, Disney will withhold programming such as upcoming movie ""Captain Marvel"" from Netflix. 
Iger said it is possible Disney may offer discounts to people who buy more than one of the three streaming services.

Dylan Lewis:    Welcome to   Industry Focus    , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock   market every day. It's Friday, February 1st. We've got fresh   earnings releases from Apple and Facebook. I'm your host, Dylan   Lewis, and I've got   fool.com    tech specialist Evan Niu on Skype. Evan, what is going on?  Evan Niu:    Tired, man! It's busy week. Like I said last week, earnings   season.  Lewis:    There's no sleep for you during earnings season. [laughs] You   have to keep up to date on what's going on with all these   companies. Someone's got to do it. It's a tough job. We   appreciate that you do it for us, Evan!  Niu:    We had a lot of big companies this week. We can only cover so   much, though.  Lewis:    We can only cover so much. We're going to spend today's show   talking about Apple and Facebook, two businesses that we frankly   spend a lot of time on. I'm wary of overcovering them because   they're very popular, they're very widely reported on. I look at   both of the earnings that we're going to discuss today, though,   and say these are companies that are at critical crossroads. For   Apple, it's a change in how they're actually doing some of their   reporting. This is the first time we're getting a glimpse of   that. For Facebook, it's a business that has some serious risks   to address. For those reasons, even though we talk about them   quite a bit, it's worth diving into these releases, Evan.  Niu:    I think both companies are definitely facing their own respective   challenges in different ways. It's not often you hear about Apple   facing these [...] iPhone, but that's exactly what's happening.   Total revenue fell 5% to $84.3 billion. Net income was about flat   at $20 billion. Bu   t earnings    per share hit a new record of $4.18 just because Apple keeps   buying back so much thought that the profit gets spread out   across a fewer number of shares, highly accretive to earnings per   share. iPhone revenue, of course, is a big one there, and that   fell 15% to $52 billion.  Lewis:    But outside of the iPhone segment, everything looked awesome. If   you just cover up that one part of the earnings release,   everything else looks great.  Niu:    Yeah, everything else was really good. But that's always the   irony, Apple's a victim of its own success in that the iPhone was   so successful, it became so big and such a huge business, over   60% of revenue total. Any weakness there is going to really hit   the overall results pretty heavily. But outside iPhone, like you   mentioned, iPad revenue put up its strongest growth in nearly six   years. It was up 17% to $6.7 billion. Pricing is probably a big   key there, as we've seen the company to do in the past year or   two. They've been pulling this pricing lever. The iPad Pros that   they launched last year saw some nice little price bumps along   with the new design. Mac revenue increase to $7.4 billion. The   new segment that they established, it used to be called Other   Products, is now Wearables, Home, and Accessories. That business   saw sales jump 33% to about $7.3 billion. Most of that's being   driven by Apple Watch and AirPods. Services, Apple has talked a   lot about Services, as we know, the past two years. New record of   $10.9 billion. For 2018, they did about $41 billion in revenue   for services. That's a pretty new record. We talked about before,   their goal is to hit $50 billion by 2020. They're well on their   way.  Lewis:    We knew that a lot of these numbers were going to be coming   because we got that note from Tim Cook earlier in the month   detailing that they would be below guidance and that they were   revising their outlook for the quarter, and that Wall Street   should be ready for some lower numbers. So, we knew generally   what the numbers were going to be. I think when we're looking at   this report, it's much more about the story and the commentary   that we're getting from management. This was the first time that   we weren't getting the nuts-and-bolts inputs of iPhone ASPs and   units sold. It's a little tough to lose it, especially when the   iPhone segment isn't doing particularly well.  Niu:    Right. And you're right, they did give investors a pretty   comprehensive idea of what to expect with that guidance letter. A   lot of the main headline figures were more or less already known   in advance. The big new thing here is that they've changed their   financial reporting structure. As you mentioned, they're no   longer giving out unit sales or ASP data. Kind of leaving people   in the dark there, which is not a great thing. On the flip side,   now what they're doing is even more aggressively pointing to the   Services business to say, ""Hey, look how profitable this is.""   Now, they're breaking out cost of sales in products as well as   cost of sales of services. You can get a good sense of how   profitable is the Hardware business vs. the Services business.   This was the first time they've ever given this data. Services   had a 63% gross margin. That was up like 5% from a year ago.   That's super profitable compared to the 34% hardware margin that   they enjoy on the product side of the business.  Lewis:    Yeah, so basically $1 in Services revenue is worth about $2 in   actual product revenue because that margin is so much larger. We   got a little bit more color on some of the inputs within the   Services segment as well. This is part of management trying to   shift the focus and shift the narrative with this business. I   appreciate the detail since we're going to be losing a lot of the   detail on the iPhone side.  Niu:    Right. A lot of these Services are really growing and scaling   quite well, which is letting them have some operating leverage,   which is why we see the gross margin expanding. Breaking it down   a little bit further, Apple Music now has 50 million paid   subscribers. The last update they'd given investors was 40   million back in April 2018. At some point in 2018, they also   said, ""We have 50 million total including free trials,"" but   that's not really a comparable number because you want to focus   on the paid side of it. So, they're at 50 million now in Apple   Music. They have 360 million paid subscriptions going across all   their platforms. That's the same pace that they've been adding.   Every quarter, they add about 30 million. More of the same there,   in terms of the trajectory. They do now expect to hit 500 million   paid subscriptions at some point in 2020.  Lewis:    One of the numbers that I loved in this release was the breakout   of how important any of these individual Service segment   customers are to the overall services revenue. This is the   breakout that you'd expect to see from a maybe   software-as-a-service company going public and trying to explain,   ""We're pretty well diversified among our customer base. We're not   too reliant on one."" In the case of Apple, the largest customer   when it comes to Services is a fraction of a percent of   revenue.  Niu:    Right. They were trying to distance themselves from this problem   they've had over the past few years, which we've just touched on.   So much the overall business is concentrated on the iPhone, and   that's a blessing and a curse. It becomes this concentration   risk. Luca Maestri, the CFO, was trying to highlight how the   Services business is much more diversified. Largest subcategory   within the Services business is about 30% of revenue. Over 30,000   different subscription apps available. The biggest of them is   0.3%. I think it's pretty obvious that that's   Netflix    . There's some interesting implications there, too. But overall,   they're not relying too heavily on any one third-party app or   subscription to grow this business.  Lewis:    It's funny, because we look at Services and we say, well, it's   not the biggest piece of the pie in terms of revenue for Apple.   In the scale of Apple, sometimes you forget that this business is   on the scale of most multinational companies, this Services   segment they have. The level of detail we're getting now reminds   me of the kind o   f report    ing you would get for almost any other Services company. For   them, it just happens to be nested within this larger hardware   empire.  Niu:    Right, exactly. So now, they're going to start giving more   information about the installed base. They also disclosed for the   first time ever what the iPhone installed base is. People have   been trying to come up with third-party estimates always, but   Apple now says, ""Hey, we have 900 million iPhones. That's our   installed base right now. That's up 75 million over the past   year."" And to your point, that's how a company like   Microsoft    might talk about its Office business, in terms of how many   commercial seats they have or how many consumer seats they have.   It's all about the seats that you have that are generating that   recurring revenue. The installed base is really the driver behind the Services   business. Apple's challenge is, they're trying to get more people   to be subscribing and paying for these things. They are making   progress on that front.  Lewis:    Evan, I want to spend a little time talking about some of the   major challenges that led to this revised guidance that we saw.   Tim Cook spent some time on this during the conference call. I   think it's worth looking at these because when I take a   big-picture look at this business, a lot of this doesn't seem   like simply one-quarter issues. This seems like stuff that might   plague the business for a while. One of the things that he   focuses on is the fact that the strength of the U.S. dollar is   making Apple products more expensive in other parts of the world.   In the conference call, he specifically talks about Turkey and   the fact that the lira has depreciated 33% over the past year.   When you think about that type of relative currency depreciation,   that makes Apple products so much more expensive in these other   markets.  Niu:    Right. That's been a real challenge for them. Here in the U.S.,   we're not subject to that kind of volatility. Obviously, Apple   prices their products in U.S. dollars and we're in the U.S. You   don't have this volatility associated with exchange rates. In   international markets, particularly emerging markets, when the   U.S. dollar is strengthening against the local currency, Apple   has to adjust its prices, and effectively increase its prices,   just to bring the same amount of money home in U.S. dollar terms.   But from a local consumer's perspective, this iPhone has just   gone up in price over the past year. For example, the Tim Cook mentioned that the iPhone XS starts   at $1,000. Last year's iPhone X, also $1,000. But if you're a   local consumer in one of those international markets, XS might   start 20% higher than X did last year. That's not something   that's good for sales. That's hard to justify to consumers. They   don't care about the foreign exchange implications to Apple, they   just want to get a good product.  Lewis:    Yeah. For a while, it's something that they haven't been as   concerned about. They've done hedging on foreign exchange, but   they haven't really worked that as much into their pricing   strategy. It seems like that might be shifting a little bit.  Niu:    Right. Now, they're going to basically say, ""We're going to try   to eat these costs, absorb the impacts, if these foreign   currencies are moving against us."" They're going to try their   best not to raise prices and just absorb it within their   organization, which could hurt profitability. Like you mentioned,   they do have this hedging program in place. They're going to try   to use the hedging program in as many markets as they can to   predict and offset these movements. But, of course,    currency market    s are very volatile. If they're more volatile than Apple expects,   that's where it can start to eat into their profits a little bit,   depending on how these things play out.  Lewis:    One of the other major points that Tim Cook emphasized in the   conference call was the disappearing subsidies in the wireless   market. This is something that a lot of U.S. consumers are   probably pretty comfortable with and understand conceptually at   this point. We're several years out from a lot of the major   providers like   Verizon    ,   AT&T    , etc., giving you that, ""Hey, you can get the newest iPhone for   $200, $250. We're going to eat the cost above that because we   want you on our network."" That's not the case in other markets.   There are other markets where subsidies in the wireless space are   much more common, or were. They're getting rolled back a little   bit, as well.  Niu:    Right. In the U.S., it's been two to four years since the subside   model started to go away, mostly thanks to   T-Mobile    shifting toward this more transparent installment plan model and   leasing model where you know exactly what you're paying and you   spread it out over time. A subsidy hid that cost from you. All   U.S. consumers, when we started to come around to the new model,   there was the sticker shock of like, ""Oh, wow, smartphones   actually cost $500 to $800,"" now $1,000. In other markets like Japan, they're still predominantly on   the subsidy model. Those markets still have to make the   transition that the U.S. did a couple of years ago.  Lewis:    And that's going to sting the ability for them to charge high   prices on top of some of the other forex issues that they might   be running into. One of the other things they emphasized is the   battery replacement program. We've talked about this in the past,   but I think it's worth repeating here. That's something that   undeniably extended the useful life of models that people already   had, which made them far less likely to upgrade to the new stuff   that Apple has made available.  Niu:    Right. They replaced an estimated 11 million batteries under the   program throughout all of 2018. On a normal year, they'd only   replace one or two million. That's 9 or 10 million devices that   have batteries replaced that could have turned into sales. I   don't remember the number off the top my head, but I ran the   numbers a while ago. It's billions of dollars' worth of   potentially lost sales of people that might have upgraded their   phones that year, but instead just got a new a battery for   $30.  Lewis:    Yeah. A lot of big issues. I think the biggest, though, and   anyone that's been following the Apple story so far, is China.   They said that basically, the miss is almost single-handedly   attributable to China and them not anticipating what would be   happening in that market and the way that it would play out over   the last couple of months. I don't really think that that's going   to change anytime soon, Evan.  Niu:    Yeah. Greater China was by far the big weakness here. Sales fell   almost 30% to like $13 billion. iPad, Mac, and iPhone all   declined. That weakness is really only partially offset by the   strength in other areas. There's ongoing trade tensions with the   U.S. There's also a sense of economic nationalism, a lot of   Chinese consumers are kind of trying to stay away from foreign   brands and buying these local bands like   Xiaomi    or Huawei, who are also making really good phones at very   affordable prices nowadays. It's this culmination of all these   different factors, some of which are macroeconomic and beyond   Apple's control, but some of them are very much within Apple's   control.  Lewis:    Thinking about how all this might play into the business for the   quarter that we're currently in, and that they'll be reporting   when they give results in May, they're forecasting revenue   between $55 billion and $59 billion. If they were to get the   upper end of that guidance range, they'd be coming in where Wall   Street is expecting them to. It seems like it's possible that we   could be looking at another somewhat disappointing quarter from   this company when they report again.  Niu:    Yeah, that's why I was surprised. The market likes the report   overall. Apple shares went up. But their guidance wasn't that   great. It could be that people thought they were going to issue   way worse, and it wasn't as bad as they'd thought it would   be. Yeah, they're going to have to stretch just to hit basic   consensus estimates on revenue. At the same time, they've talked   a lot about all these challenges they're facing. They're working   hard to tackle them and address them. We'll have to see over the   next couple of months what kind of progress they make on these   important fronts.  Lewis:    Apple feels to me a lot like a company that is trying to find a   new identity. They know that the growth lever that they've had   for a really long time -- the iPhone segment -- isn't what it has   been historically, and that the game is changing a little bit.   They seem to have understood that well, and started to build out   and emphasize the Services segment; but I don't know that from a   share price perspective or from a growth perspective, we're at a   point where that's going to be immediately realized anytime   soon.  Niu:    This transition to emphasize the Services business has been going   on for about two years now. It's very obvious to me that most   investors are still very focused on the iPhone business, unit   sales, hardware sales, because the reality is, that's still the   bulk of the business. I think it's going to take more time still   before investors shift their perception and appreciate that this   hardware sales piece is really important, but the Services   business is growing really well. It's much more profitable, as   they're now showing. They're making progress in getting people   where they want, in terms of perception, but I do think it's   going to take a little more time.  Lewis:    All right. Evan, we want to talk Facebook today, too. It's kind   of funny that we're talking about Apple and Facebook in the same   show. These are two companies that maybe aren't particularly   thrilled with each other right now.  Niu:    [laughs] Yeah, they had this little dispute this week. To try to   sum it up quickly, Facebook's been using an enterprise developer   certificate to distribute this research app that was basically   spying on people. Apple revoked their certificate, and that broke   all of their internal development apps. [laughs] At this point,   they've given it back, so I think everything's OK now. But it's a   pretty big conflict between the two because Apple is so   pro-privacy, and Facebook has had so many privacy scandals.  Lewis:    And this is the latest in a series of public jabs between   Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook. I think they like to get in   their shots when they can. The episode recently came out about   them taking advantage of some of this access to get some more   consumer data, and paying for it, but still being a little shady   in that. It reminds me of this thought that I had a little while   ago. I think that Facebook is the   Wells Fargo    of tech at this point. You look at this company, and you're like,   OK, I think we've gotten through it, I think we've weathered all   of the bad news that could possibly come up. And just when you   get there, there's another headline, Evan.  Niu:    It's just back to back to back. [laughs] It's really crazy how   the media is able to just keep digging up all these stories.   Every story that comes out, it's Facebook doing more shady stuff.   The recent episode also highlights how much power Apple has over   Facebook, if they can flip a switch and break all of Facebook's   stuff. And Apple's right. Facebook was very clearly violating its   policy with how these certificates were supposed to be used. But   it's interesting because one of the biggest risk factors to   Facebook has always been that it relies almost entirely on these   third-party mobile platforms for its business. 93% of advertising   revenue is mobile ads. And Apple totally controls that business.   Theoretically -- not that this would happen -- if Apple were to   take Facebook's app off the Store, Facebook is just toast.   [laughs]  Lewis:    It would take something pretty ridiculous for them to do that. We   mentioned all the trouble they've had and all the bad news that's   come out. And yet, the business just keeps churning along. You'd   think that at some point, it would be the straw that broke the   camel's back. We look at the user numbers, we look at the revenue   that we've gotten in this most recent report that came out this   week, everything's coming up aces for them.  Niu:    And that's the same way it's been all year. All 2018, it's   scandal, scandal, scandal, and almost every quarter, they put up   strong numbers. In the summer, they reported earnings and had a   huge drop because of the guidance. But the user numbers have been   resilient this entire time. Fourth quarter alone, revenue was up   30% to $16.9 billion. They also hit a record profit of $6.9   billion. These numbers are just astounding.  Lewis:    On the user side, DAUs reached 1.5 billion, which is up 9%. They   have a denominator that is at a billion-plus, and they're still   able to grow DAUs 9%. MAUs also up 9%, reaching 2.32 billion. Most of that growth is coming from developing parts of the   world. All of the markets that they were in early, like United   States, North America, Europe, those are pretty saturated at this   point. A lot of the user growth is coming from the Philippines   and countries like that.  Niu:    Right. Even beyond the user numbers, in terms of monetization, I   was also really impressed with their advertising average revenue   per user in North America. It hit a new record of $34, which is   just insane. I thought it was good at $24 a few quarters ago, but   now they're all the way up to $34. They're continuing to really   ramp this monetization. Of course, there's a lot going on there   with the dynamics of the ad business, but the overall number is   incredibly strong, still.  Lewis:    One number that does speak to that, and where the additions are   coming from on the user side, and how that impacts the business,   is we saw that ad prices went down. They were down about 2% year   over year. That's because the ability to monetize some of the   people that are coming on in developing markets just isn't there   in the same way that American users or Canadian users or European   users would. There's a different value in terms of ad reach to   those different regions. That's probably going to continue to   happen a little bit as we see more and more of the growth come   from developing parts of the world. Another thing to keep in mind as you're looking at that ad   price number is that a lot of the ad load in the feeds for   Facebook and for Instagram is fairly saturated, as well. A lot of   the new impressions that we're going to be seeing on these   platforms are going to be in the Stories product, which is new   testing ground for a lot of these ad companies.  Niu:    Right. They said ad impressions were up 34%. That's primarily   being driven by Instagram. Some of the slippage in the pricing,   they also mentioned, some of the usage of their services is   shifting toward these features that are less monetized currently,   like Stories. But, they have started to monetize Stories now.   They have two million advertisers that are already promoting   inside of Stories. They basically have to navigate that shift,   but they've been able to navigate these types of shifts in the   past, so I would be pretty confident that they'd be able to do   that again. But, that's part of what the challenge is right now,   being able to transition there.  Lewis:    All told, the company said that they have 2.7 billion people   using one of their properties in the month of December, which is   just incredible. Managements emphasis of that number speaks to a   larger organizational philosophy of, ""OK, let's look at   everything holistically. Let's look at all of this as a portfolio   of properties rather than just one, another one over here, and a   third and fourth.""  Niu:    Right. They first introduced that metric last summer, this   familywide audience metric. Back then, it was 2.5 billion. Now,   it's at 2.7 billion. That number is still growing. But yeah, I   agree. A lot of what's happening is that the core Facebook   platform has always been very important, but most of the growth   these days is coming from other platforms like Instagram. The   more significant financially that these other platforms become,   it calls to question, when are you going to start breaking out   more detailed results and metrics and give investors this   transparency around these other businesses that are super   important? I think, basically, what this familywide audience   number does is acknowledging that, yes, this is really becoming   more important outside of Facebook. But instead of giving us   broken-down numbers here and there and on each individual   platform, they're just going to combine it all. I think it makes   a lot more sense that way because if you look at it, they also   advertise across all platforms. When you're buying ads on   Facebook, you can have them automatically place it for you, on   any of their platforms. So in a sense, they already treat them   all like one platform. This is just reinforcing that   approach.  Lewis:    It also ties into this major news item we saw a little while back   about the company deciding to merge some of the messaging apps,   looking at what they're doing WhatsApp and the end-to-end   encryption, and possibly rolling that into some of the properties   that people are maybe a little bit more familiar with with   Messenger.  Niu:    Right. That report came out a few days before the release. But   then, Mark Zuckerberg basically confirmed the plans, saying,   ""Yes, we're looking at integrating these messaging services a   little bit more."" Think about, you're a user looking at a   classified ad on Marketplace, and then you want to message the   listing, you're interested in buying it; but then, you have to go   to Messenger. What if you're in an emerging market where WhatsApp   is the big popular service there? You have to go to WhatsApp. You   know what I mean? There's all these different ways, and that can   be jarring. The idea is to unify these apps, allow you to message   across the services better for the sake of user experience.  Lewis:    Looking forward, Facebook is trying to wave the flag a little bit   and say more revenue deceleration is coming. This is something   that they've been trying to get the Street to understand for   quite some time. We talked a little bit about the reasons for   that, in that the ad loads are pretty saturated on the news feeds   for Facebook and Instagram, most of the growth is going to be   coming from Stories, which have lower CPMs. So much of the   opportunity still remains very untapped. If you look over at   WhatsApp and Messenger in particular, they've done a little bit   of testing there, but by and large, there isn't a lot there in   terms of activity that's monetized, and it doesn't really seem   like they're in any rush to do it.  Niu:    Right. Instagram is really up and running, charging forward with   monetization. But the messenger services have always been a   little bit trickier to get a good model on how to monetize the   usage. They're very up front that it's basically immaterial at   this point. They have ads in these products. They're also   connecting businesses to consumers. But these aren't really   bringing in a lot of money. They're still not really meaningful   in terms of financials right now. I think that they can focus on   that later. The real key is going to be to be able to grow revenue, even   if it's decelerating. They have big plans in store in terms of   their costs and investments in the business. Total costs are   expected to go up by 40% or 50% next year. That's $43 billion to   $46 billion in total cost for next year. Capex will be $18   billion to $20 billion. They're investing heavily in the   business, particularly on the safety and security side. Mark   Zuckerberg said they tripled their workforce from 10,000 to   30,000. They're going to have to grow that top line to pay for   all that stuff.  Lewis:    And that's hopefully addressing a lot of the criticisms that the   company has very rightly had to field over the last couple of   years. Something that was curious to me in this report, Evan, a   little buried in there, wasn't in the PR part of the release, but   if you look over the 10-K, we see in Facebook's release the   mention of   Amazon    .  Niu:    Yeah, they actually mentioned Amazon as a competitor in   advertising for the first time ever. We've talked about before,   Amazon is really expanding aggressively into advertising because,   of course, advertising and commerce go hand in hand. They're such   a huge player in commerce that they have a huge opportunity with   having merchants advertise on Amazon directly, as opposed to   Google    or Facebook.  Lewis:    Yeah. So, you see both of these companies treading into the other   one's space a little bit. With Facebook deciding to focus a   little bit more on commerce and seeing what the opportunities   might be there on Instagram in particular, because it lends   itself so well with product featuring; and Amazon deciding,   ""We're going to check out ads and see what we can do there."" It's   funny to see them dipping their toes in each other's ponds, so to   speak.  Niu:    Yeah. It really speaks to, 2018 for Facebook was all about   beefing up safety and security after all of these scandals. I   think that now that they've made some progress on that front --   obviously, there's still new scandals coming every week,   apparently. [laughs] But, I think 2019, they're going to try to   refocus back on core product development. Zuckerberg was saying   that they want to be introducing new social experiences, new ways   for people to interact and connect on their platform. Commerce is   certainly a part of that.  Lewis:    I think a big part of that is the acknowledgment that the way   that they've made money over the past couple of years, especially   on the namesake platform, isn't necessarily how they're going to   make money in perpetuity. They need to add functionality to these   platforms, and they need to build out new ways to monetize their   users because there are ad dynamics that are going to impact   their ability to continue to make solid revenue on those   experiences.  Niu:    Right. Their other segment, payments and other fees, actually   went up about 40%. That was actually driven mostly by their   hardware side, which is a new business for Facebook. Oculus Go,   which isn't exactly new, Oculus Go's new product, they're ramping   that. Portal is definitely a new product, Facebook-branded   hardware. Zuckerberg said that beat his expectations. I don't   know how many people actually bought that thing, [laughs] or are   willing to put a Facebook camera in their home after all these   privacy concerns, so I wonder how low his expectations were. But,   there are other parts of the business, to your point. They're   diversifying outside of ads. They're finding new ways to build   this business.  Lewis:    I would like to put a call out to our listeners here. I have not   seen a Facebook Portal in person. Evan, it doesn't sound like you   own one in your home, either.  Niu:    [laughs] Nope!  Lewis:    [laughs] So, if anyone does have experience with one, I would   love to hear about that and what you use it for. That was   something that was a head-scratcher for me in terms of hardware,   especially given a lot of the news that came out about that   company when they decided to make that release. So, I'd love to   get the consumer perspective on that. Feel free to write in if   that is your experience. Evan, anything else you want to hit with Facebook or Apple   before we wrap up today's show?  Niu:    No, I think we're good!  Lewis:    All right. Listeners, that's going to do it for this episode of   Industry Focus    . A little housekeeping note here. This is going to be our last   episode, for a little while, with our dear producer Austin   Morgan. He's going to be out of commission for a bit.  Austin Morgan:    Yep. Getting my labrum and my rotator cuff put back together on   Tuesday. If any of you have any Netflix recommendations, I would   gladly take them.  Lewis:    [laughs] Do you have any bits of wisdom for our listeners, having   gone through the experience of hurting yourself? [laughs]  Morgan:    It's just not worth it!  Lewis:    It's just not worth it! Maybe the story behind how you hurt   yourself is worth telling?  Morgan:    We were playing a softball tournament. Last game of the day, we   were about to lose because we lost a girl, so we were down a   person. We were losing anyway. Ball hit up the line. I was   playing right field.

",https://www.nasdaq.com/article/a-change-of-seasons-for-apple-cm1093328,2019-02-05 09:28:00-05:00,False,2019-02-05,"It's earnings season, and in this week's    Industry Focus: Tech     , host Dylan Lewis and Motley Fool contributor Evan Niu look at   updates from two of the giants,   Facebook    (NASDAQ: FB) and   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) .
Whether investors like it or not, Apple stopped   reporting iPhone unit sales.
How significant is this whole   Services thing they keep emphasizing, and what does this all mean   for Apple's long-term picture from here?
Meanwhile, investors who were expecting Facebook's   scandal-fest to concretely hurt their business were probably   surprised by this most recen   t report    .
We've got fresh   earnings releases from Apple and Facebook.
I'm your host, Dylan   Lewis, and I've got   fool.com    tech specialist Evan Niu on Skype.
Niu:    We had a lot of big companies this week.
We're going to spend today's show   talking about Apple and Facebook, two businesses that we frankly   spend a lot of time on.
Niu:    I think both companies are definitely facing their own respective   challenges in different ways.
Bu   t earnings    per share hit a new record of $4.18 just because Apple keeps   buying back so much thought that the profit gets spread out   across a fewer number of shares, highly accretive to earnings per   share.
But that's always the   irony, Apple's a victim of its own success in that the iPhone was   so successful, it became so big and such a huge business, over   60% of revenue total.
But outside iPhone, like you   mentioned, iPad revenue put up its strongest growth in nearly six   years.
Pricing is probably a big   key there, as we've seen the company to do in the past year or   two.
Services, Apple has talked a   lot about Services, as we know, the past two years.
Lewis:    We knew that a lot of these numbers were going to be coming   because we got that note from Tim Cook earlier in the month   detailing that they would be below guidance and that they were   revising their outlook for the quarter, and that Wall Street   should be ready for some lower numbers.
On the flip side,   now what they're doing is even more aggressively pointing to the   Services business to say, ""Hey, look how profitable this is.""   Now, they're breaking out cost of sales in products as well as   cost of sales of services.
Lewis:    Yeah, so basically $1 in Services revenue is worth about $2 in   actual product revenue because that margin is so much larger.
I   appreciate the detail since we're going to be losing a lot of the   detail on the iPhone side.
Breaking it down   a little bit further, Apple Music now has 50 million paid   subscribers.
Lewis:    One of the numbers that I loved in this release was the breakout   of how important any of these individual Service segment   customers are to the overall services revenue.
This is the   breakout that you'd expect to see from a maybe   software-as-a-service company going public and trying to explain,   ""We're pretty well diversified among our customer base.
We're not   too reliant on one."" In the case of Apple, the largest customer   when it comes to Services is a fraction of a percent of   revenue.
Lewis:    It's funny, because we look at Services and we say, well, it's   not the biggest piece of the pie in terms of revenue for Apple.
In the scale of Apple, sometimes you forget that this business is   on the scale of most multinational companies, this Services   segment they have.
People have   been trying to come up with third-party estimates always, but   Apple now says, ""Hey, we have 900 million iPhones.
That's up 75 million over the past   year."" And to your point, that's how a company like   Microsoft    might talk about its Office business, in terms of how many   commercial seats they have or how many consumer seats they have.
Lewis:    Evan, I want to spend a little time talking about some of the   major challenges that led to this revised guidance that we saw.
I   think it's worth looking at these because when I take a   big-picture look at this business, a lot of this doesn't seem   like simply one-quarter issues.
One of the things that he   focuses on is the fact that the strength of the U.S. dollar is   making Apple products more expensive in other parts of the world.
When you think about that type of relative currency depreciation,   that makes Apple products so much more expensive in these other   markets.
In   international markets, particularly emerging markets, when the   U.S. dollar is strengthening against the local currency, Apple   has to adjust its prices, and effectively increase its prices,   just to bring the same amount of money home in U.S. dollar terms.
If they're more volatile than Apple expects,   that's where it can start to eat into their profits a little bit,   depending on how these things play out.
We're several years out from a lot of the major   providers like   Verizon    ,   AT&T    , etc., giving you that, ""Hey, you can get the newest iPhone for   $200, $250.
All   U.S. consumers, when we started to come around to the new model,   there was the sticker shock of like, ""Oh, wow, smartphones   actually cost $500 to $800,"" now $1,000.
That's something that   undeniably extended the useful life of models that people already   had, which made them far less likely to upgrade to the new stuff   that Apple has made available.
It's billions of dollars' worth of   potentially lost sales of people that might have upgraded their   phones that year, but instead just got a new a battery for   $30.
There's ongoing trade tensions with the   U.S. There's also a sense of economic nationalism, a lot of   Chinese consumers are kind of trying to stay away from foreign   brands and buying these local bands like   Xiaomi    or Huawei, who are also making really good phones at very   affordable prices nowadays.
Lewis:    Thinking about how all this might play into the business for the   quarter that we're currently in, and that they'll be reporting   when they give results in May, they're forecasting revenue   between $55 billion and $59 billion.
Lewis:    Apple feels to me a lot like a company that is trying to find a   new identity.
They know that the growth lever that they've had   for a really long time -- the iPhone segment -- isn't what it has   been historically, and that the game is changing a little bit.
They seem to have understood that well, and started to build out   and emphasize the Services segment; but I don't know that from a   share price perspective or from a growth perspective, we're at a   point where that's going to be immediately realized anytime   soon.
Niu:    This transition to emphasize the Services business has been going   on for about two years now.
I think it's going to take more time still   before investors shift their perception and appreciate that this   hardware sales piece is really important, but the Services   business is growing really well.
They're making progress in getting people   where they want, in terms of perception, but I do think it's   going to take a little more time.
It's kind   of funny that we're talking about Apple and Facebook in the same   show.
But it's a   pretty big conflict between the two because Apple is so   pro-privacy, and Facebook has had so many privacy scandals.
You look at this company, and you're like,   OK, I think we've gotten through it, I think we've weathered all   of the bad news that could possibly come up.
But   it's interesting because one of the biggest risk factors to   Facebook has always been that it relies almost entirely on these   third-party mobile platforms for its business.
And Apple totally controls that business.
We look at the user numbers, we look at the revenue   that we've gotten in this most recent report that came out this   week, everything's coming up aces for them.
Of course, there's a lot going on there   with the dynamics of the ad business, but the overall number is   incredibly strong, still.
Lewis:    One number that does speak to that, and where the additions are   coming from on the user side, and how that impacts the business,   is we saw that ad prices went down.
That's probably going to continue to   happen a little bit as we see more and more of the growth come   from developing parts of the world.
Another thing to keep in mind as you're looking at that ad   price number is that a lot of the ad load in the feeds for   Facebook and for Instagram is fairly saturated, as well.
A lot of   the new impressions that we're going to be seeing on these   platforms are going to be in the Stories product, which is new   testing ground for a lot of these ad companies.
Lewis:    All told, the company said that they have 2.7 billion people   using one of their properties in the month of December, which is   just incredible.
A lot of what's happening is that the core Facebook   platform has always been very important, but most of the growth   these days is coming from other platforms like Instagram.
The   more significant financially that these other platforms become,   it calls to question, when are you going to start breaking out   more detailed results and metrics and give investors this   transparency around these other businesses that are super   important?
I think it makes   a lot more sense that way because if you look at it, they also   advertise across all platforms.
Lewis:    It also ties into this major news item we saw a little while back   about the company deciding to merge some of the messaging apps,   looking at what they're doing WhatsApp and the end-to-end   encryption, and possibly rolling that into some of the properties   that people are maybe a little bit more familiar with with   Messenger.
But   then, Mark Zuckerberg basically confirmed the plans, saying,   ""Yes, we're looking at integrating these messaging services a   little bit more."" Think about, you're a user looking at a   classified ad on Marketplace, and then you want to message the   listing, you're interested in buying it; but then, you have to go   to Messenger.
Lewis:    Looking forward, Facebook is trying to wave the flag a little bit   and say more revenue deceleration is coming.
We talked a little bit about the reasons for   that, in that the ad loads are pretty saturated on the news feeds   for Facebook and Instagram, most of the growth is going to be   coming from Stories, which have lower CPMs. So much of the   opportunity still remains very untapped.
If you look over at   WhatsApp and Messenger in particular, they've done a little bit   of testing there, but by and large, there isn't a lot there in   terms of activity that's monetized, and it doesn't really seem   like they're in any rush to do it.
Lewis:    And that's hopefully addressing a lot of the criticisms that the   company has very rightly had to field over the last couple of   years.
Something that was curious to me in this report, Evan, a   little buried in there, wasn't in the PR part of the release, but   if you look over the 10-K, we see in Facebook's release the   mention of   Amazon    .
With Facebook deciding to focus a   little bit more on commerce and seeing what the opportunities   might be there on Instagram in particular, because it lends   itself so well with product featuring; and Amazon deciding,   ""We're going to check out ads and see what we can do there."" It's   funny to see them dipping their toes in each other's ponds, so to   speak.
I   think that now that they've made some progress on that front --   obviously, there's still new scandals coming every week,   apparently.
[laughs] But, I think 2019, they're going to try to   refocus back on core product development.
Lewis:    I think a big part of that is the acknowledgment that the way   that they've made money over the past couple of years, especially   on the namesake platform, isn't necessarily how they're going to   make money in perpetuity.
They need to add functionality to these   platforms, and they need to build out new ways to monetize their   users because there are ad dynamics that are going to impact   their ability to continue to make solid revenue on those   experiences.
That was actually driven mostly by their   hardware side, which is a new business for Facebook.
Lewis:    I would like to put a call out to our listeners here.

74,"February 05, 2019, 09:07:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Don't Overlook These Metrics From Amazon's Fourth-Quarter Update,"
 For the most part,   Amazon    's (NASDAQ: AMZN)    fourth-quarter update    impressed investors. Revenue growth was strong, and earnings per   share soared. But the company's guidance for slower revenue   growth in its first quarter and heavy investments for the full   year worried some investors. As they look over Amazon's results for the important holiday   period, here's a look beyond the headline metrics. Given how   far-reaching the e-commerce and cloud-computing company is,   there's a lot of information from the update for investors to   consider. These four metrics are important but could easily be   overlooked:makeArticleAd();   Image source: Getty Images.   1. Free cash flow  Sometimes it's good to back away from the details in a   financial update and take a 10,000-foot-view of one of the most   important metrics of a business: its free cash flow. Defined as   operating cash flow less capital expenditures, free cash flow   captures the cold, hard cash that is the foundation of valuing   any company. Amazon is not only generating heady levels of free cash flow,   but it's also growing fast. With the help of its strong fourth   quarter, Amazon's free cash flow in 2018 was $19.4 billion, up   134% year over year versus $8.3 billion in 2017.  2. Online stores revenue  Amazon's online stores revenue, or revenue primarily generated   from e-commerce sales (excluding online subscription services   revenue), increased 14% year over year in constant currency.   While this is slower than Amazon's consolidated year-over-year   revenue growth of 20%, it marks a meaningful acceleration from   the company's 10% constant-currency year-over-year growth in   online stores revenue in Q3.  3. AWS operating margin  Amazon's cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS),   continues to be the company's cash cow. Operating income from the   segment surged from $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 to   $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. While AWS' 45%   year-over-year revenue growth contributed to this big increase in   segment operating income, the segment's expanding operating   margin helped meaningfully, too. AWS' operating margin widened   from 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 29.3% in the fourth   quarter of 2018.  4. Subscription services revenue  Finally, Amazon's subscription services revenue, or revenue   generated from annual and monthly fees related to the company's   Amazon Prime membership and its audiobook, video, e-book, music,   and other non-AWS services, saw revenue rise 25% year over year   in constant currency. While this is strong relative to the company's consolidated   top-line growth, it's a notable deceleration from the 52% growth   the segment saw in the company's third quarter of 2018. But after   adjusting for an accounting change that hurt the segment's   revenue during the quarter, subscriptions revenue increased 34%   year over year. Growth in the segments discussed in this article, along with   strong performance from Amazon's third-party seller services and   ""other"" revenue, helped the company's total fourth-quarter   revenue rise 20% year over year to $72.4 billion. Earnings per   share for the period were $6.04, up from $3.75 in the fourth   quarter of 2017.

77,"February 05, 2019, 08:09:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) Q2 Earnings: What's in Store?,"
  Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA  is expected to report second-quarter fiscal 2019 results soon.  makeArticleAd();  Investors should note that the majority of Twenty-First Century Fox's film and television assets will be acquired by Disney DIS  in a cash-and-stock deal worth $71.3 billion. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2019. Following the acquisition, a new entity called Fox Corporation will be formed, which will host an array of sports, news and entertainment content from the likes of FOX Sports, FOX News, FOX Network and FOX Television Stations.   Estimate Revision Trends    The company's earnings beat the Zack Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, delivering average positive surprise of 3.6%.    In fiscal first-quarter 2019, adjusted earnings increased 6.1% from the year-ago quarter to 52 cents per share. Revenues increased 2.5% from the year-ago quarter to $7.18 billion.    Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings has remained stable at 31 cents per share over the past seven days, indicating a decline of 26.2% year over year.    Nevertheless, the consensus mark for revenues, which is pegged at $8.6 billion, indicates 6.8% year-over-year increase.   Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise         Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Price and EPS   Surprise    |      Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. Quote      Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.     Key Factors to Consider      Fox is increasingly focusing on enhancing its live programming   portfolio, which is a positive. The company being the exclusive   national broadcast partner for Major League Baseball (MLB) since   2001 is expected to gain from the popularity of the sport.        Notably, baseball continues to have strong primetime ratings in   the television space per Nielsen. This is expected to command   more ad dollars for commercial slots, eventually boosting   advertising revenues. Moreover, in second-quarter fiscal 2019,   Fox inked a seven-year deal with MLB extending the current deal,   which ends in 2021. Additionally, the deal will extend Fox   Sports' digital, streaming, social media and highlight rights as   well.        Fox is also expected to benefit from its content strength. This   is evident as Facebook   FB    acquired streaming rights to all episodes of   Buffy The Vampire Slayer    ,   Angel    , and   Firefly    in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Additionally, Facebook signed   a deal with Fox to launch news shows on its platform, which is a   positive.        Further, Fox News was the most watched cable network for the   third consecutive year by both primetime and total day viewers in   2018, per Nielsen Media Research. Additionally, Fox Business   Network had the most Business Day viewers in 2018, its second   consecutive win over CNBC. We believe that Fox's growing focus on   sports along with the popularity of its networks may aid   second-quarter fiscal 2019 top-line growth.        However, intensifying competition from Amazon   AMZN    , Facebook and Twitter in the sports event broadcasting space is   a concern for Fox. While Facebook and Twitter have deals with MLB   among others, Amazon has an array of sports content including   National Football League (NFL) and National Basketball   Association (NBA) games. Moreover, higher spending from media and   streaming companies may increase Fox's programming related costs.        Fox currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

78,"February 05, 2019, 06:55:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Bear of the Day: MercadoLibre (MELI),"
makeZacksArticleAd();It is important that growing companies work to improve margins and lock in consistent profitability in a timely manner. When that growth hits a snag, it can cause volatility in share prices. Unfortunately, that's evident in MercadoLibre ( MELI ) right now.MercadoLibre is an e-commerce company. It is the largest online shopping platform in Latin America and is based in Argentina. The website attracts hundreds of millions of visitors and serves as the market leading e-commerce option in countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and more.Founded just 19 years ago, MercadoLibre is a young company that should continue to develop as access to the internet, delivery availability, and purchasing power improves in its key markets. However, it is currently being battered by rising costs, and that introduces a certain level of uncertainty that investors may want to avoid for the time being.MELI is facing margin pressure from increased warehousing expenses, a transition to the public cloud, free shipping subsidies, and discounts on certain POS devices. There is also a rising tide of competition that is threatening to take a chunk out of MELI's dominant position in the region.Notably, MELI faces competition from the likes of Amazon (AMZN), Rakuten, and Cnova on the e-commerce side. MELI might have a head start in most of its markets, but these competitors certainly know how to pack a punch. MercadoLibre could also lose market share to brick-and-mortar stores that are still developing their own digital platforms.These headwinds appear to be reflecting themselves in MELI's earnings estimate trends. MELI is expected to release its most recen t earnings report in a few weeks. For this period, analysts are projecting a quarterly loss of 15 cents per share. That's significantly wider than the eight-cent loss seen in the consensus just 90 days ago.This loss would mark a decline of 175% from the year-ago quarter. It would also put the company on pace for a full-year loss of $0.98 per share, down around 138% on a year-over-year basis.Estimates are also down for fiscal 2019. Analysts now expect earnings of $0.52 per share on the year. Just 90 days ago, that consensus was as high as $0.74 per share. Moreover, while a 52-cent profit is obviously a major improvement from 2018's loss, it is quite a ways below the $2.53 per share earned in 2017. Earnings are headed in the wrong direction from what you'd like to see out of a growth company.The Zacks Rank is founded on a belief that share prices and earnings estimate revisions are inherently related. The aforementioned sluggishness in MELI's earnings estimates has earned the stock a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) rating.It's also worth noting that MELI sports an ""F"" grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. It goes without saying that a company on the verge of a significant EPS loss is trading with a stretched earnings valuation, but other key metrics are troubling as well. For instance, one might look to the P/S ratio in this type of situation. But MELI trades with a P/S of 11.4, which is marks a sharp premium to its industry's average of 1.7.From a purely technical perspective, MELI looks to be in a better place.

Reuters

@media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}



By Aditya Kalra and Sankalp Phartiyal
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's  grocery service is slowly returning on its India website after the online retail giant faced disruption from revised e-commerce curbs which kicked in on Feb. 1.
New federal rules, which bar companies from selling products via vendors in which they have an equity interest, forced Amazon India to remove hundreds of thousands of products from its site last week. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
On Tuesday, Amazon Pantry was offering select food products,  such as cookies and tea, in New Delhi and Mumbai. Though Reuters reporters in both cities were able to place Pantry orders, several customers complained on Twitter they were struggling to get their requests fulfilled.
India allowed Amazon to retail food products in the country in 2017 and the company committed $500 million in investment. Amazon was using that government permission to sell some Pantry grocery products via an affiliate, two sources familiar with the plans told Reuters.
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Though several of Amazon's products, such as its own range of Presto-branded home cleaning goods, were still unavailable, some have returned for sale in recent days.
Some products were now being sold through sellers in which Amazon doesn't have direct or indirect equity stakes, making them compliant with the new rules, one of the sources said.
Nevertheless, the new policy has hit Amazon and Walmart hard.
Morgan Stanley warned that the new regulations would increase the cost of doing business and add uncertainty over losses for Flipkart. Walmart last year pumped in $16 billion to buy 77 percent of Flipkart in its biggest ever deal.
Though still too early to assess, Morgan Stanley said it may make sense for Walmart to ""walk away"" if it can't see a long-term path for profits in the country.
Investors too have criticized the policy, saying the sudden changes to the e-commerce curbs raise broad worries about an unstable regulatory environment in India.
""Frequent policy changes make the whole ecosystem nervous,"" said Rajat Tandon, President of the Indian Private Equity & Venture Capital Association, which counts global investors such as KKR & Co and Sequoia Capital among its members.
The new rules, however, have pleased small traders who had long complained that e-commerce giants used their control over inventory from affiliated vendors to create an unfair marketplace where they could offer discounts.

Reuters

@media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}



PARIS, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Apple's French division said it had reached a deal with France to pay an undeclared amount of back-dated tax, which French media estimated at around 500 million euros ($571 million).
Apple's French division confirmed the tax payment agreement, but did not disclose how much it had agreed to pay.
""As a multinational company, Apple is regularly audited by fiscal authorities around the world,"" Apple France said in a statement.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
French business magazine L'Express/L'Expansion, which reported the tax payment figure, said the deal was reached in December after several months of negotiations between tax authorities and the company.
France is pushing for a European Union-wide tax on the world's top digital and software companies such as Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, Amazon , Facebook  and Apple that use complex intra-group arrangements to pay low single-digit tax rates on profits derived from European customers. The arrangements are not illegal. 
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in January that he was confident European Union member states would reach an agreement by the end of March on an EU-wide tax on global digital companies. 
Online retail group Amazon settled a long-running dispute with French tax authorities in February last year. France had been seeking nearly 200 million euros ($228.20 million) from the company. ($1 = 0.7723 pounds)

 Shares of Disney DIS  climbed slightly during regular trading Monday, just one day before the entertainment giant is scheduled to release its Q1 fiscal 2019 financial results. So, let's see what investors should expect from Disney's top and bottom lines, along with key business units, after the closing bell Tuesday.  Revenue & Earnings Outlook  Disney is coming off a quarter that saw its revenues surge 12% and top estimates on the back of impressive results at the box office. Yet, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for the company's quarterly revenues to fall 1.10% from the prior-year period to reach $15.18 billion. Meanwhile, Disney's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to fall nearly 17% to $1.57 per share. No one ever likes to see earnings drop, but the firm's bottom-line performance could look even worse compared to last quarter's 38% earnings growth. DIS has also earned some negative earnings estimate revisions for Q1 and its current full year over the last 30 days, which helps Disney land a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at the moment.  Disney stock  closed regular trading Monday up 0.45% to $111.80 per share. This represented a nearly 7% downturn from its 52-week high of $120.20. Disney is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports a ""B"" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system.       Media Networks  Moving on, it's important to understand what to expect from the company's individual business units on Tuesday. Luckily, we can turn our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file to help us. Wall Street will pay close attention to the conglomerate's largest division as it houses its sports entertainment leg ESPN. Disney's Media Networks is projected to see its revenues pop 0.7% to touch $6.288 billion, which would fall below last quarter's 9% expansion. Disney's cable unit is expected to climb about 0.5% to hit $4.518 billion and its broadcast division is projected to pop just over 1%.  Parks/Resorts & Studio Entertainment  Disney's Park and Resorts revenue is expected to surge roughly 8.5% to $5.591 billion. This would fall nearly in line with last quarter's 9% expansion. On top of that, Studio Entertainment revenue is projected to reach $2.115 billion. This would mark over a 15% decline from Q1 2018 in what is Disney's most sporadic business.     Bottom Line  Clearly, these results aren't likely to inspire a great deal of confidence. With that said, investors need to pay close attention to any updates about Disney's deal to acquire key Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA  assets and its streaming TV service that is set to challenge Netflix NFLX  , Amazon AMZN  , Apple AAPL  , and AT&T T  .

84,"February 04, 2019, 05:15:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Amazon's Subscription Revenue Growth Just Fell Off a Cliff. Should Investors Panic?,"
 A key component of   Amazon    's (NASDAQ: AMZN) business is its Prime membership program.   Revenue from Prime shows up in Amazon's subscription revenue, and   it accounts for the vast majority of that line item in the   company's quarterly reports. Last quarter, subscription services revenue grew just 26% on a   constant currency basis. That's a stark slowdown from the   50%-plus growth investors saw in the first three quarters of the   year. While subscription services revenue growth is seasonally   slower in the fourth quarter, the 26% mark represents the slowest   growth we've seen since the company started breaking out the   number. Before investors panic, though, it's worth taking a closer   look at that number.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Amazon.   A big accounting change  A major accounting change went into effect in 2018 that   affected how Amazon accounts for Prime subscriptions. Instead of   weighting Prime membership revenue to the fourth quarter -- when   the benefits are used the most -- Amazon is now required to   account for memberships on a straight-line basis. CFO Brian Olsavsky said that resulted in $300 million in   subscription revenue shifting from the fourth quarter to the   first three quarters of the year. Under the old accounting rules,   Amazon would've exhibited growth of around 34%. That also means   the growth in the first three quarters of the year was   artificially higher. Adjusting for the accounting change, there's still a drop in   subscription services revenue, but it's not nearly as severe as   it looks.  The price increase is still working its way     through  Amazon raised the price of Prime for U.S. customers this   summer. New subscribers saw the price increase go into effect in   May, while existing subscribers who renewed their memberships   before June 16 got to keep the lower $99 per year price. It will take time for those price increases to fully work   through to Amazon's revenue recognition. It's still accounting   for around half of memberships at the lower annual fee because it   recognizes the revenue over the full membership year. As such,   Amazon ought to recognize steady revenue growth from the price   increase over the course of two years.  Prime membership is saturated in the U.S.  Even if the slowdown isn't as bad as it first looks, and if   Amazon does experience continued service revenue growth from the   Prime price increase over the next six quarters, there's no   denying service revenue is slowing down. That might be because Amazon has   run out of room to grow    Prime membership in the United States. That's not altogether a   bad thing. The membership base is massive, reaching 100 million   American shoppers, and those members are very loyal shoppers.   Amazon realizes tremendous   network advantages    from its U.S. Prime membership base. But Prime is certainly growing in other markets. Management   pointed out that more customers signed up for Prime worldwide in   2018 than ever before in its earnings release. Olsavsky   added during the company's   earnings call     that more people joined Prime in the fourth quarter than in   any other quarter. Prime doesn't cost as much in markets like India, where it's   growing the fastest. But keeping prices low in certain markets   enables it to capitalize on the long-term growth opportunities   they present. Amazon can always raise the price of Prime in those   markets later if it makes sense, just as it's done in the   U.S.  No need to ring the alarm  While the sudden drop-off in subscription services revenue is   a bit jarring, diving deeper into the numbers shows that Amazon's   Prime subscription business is still healthy and a major   contributor to the company's continued growth. Amazon will continue to see more modest growth from the United   States driven by pricing increases. At the same time,   international Prime memberships ought to become a bigger piece of   the pie over the next couple of years, eventually becoming the   main growth driver for subscription services. That could result   in a reacceleration of growth over time.

85,"February 04, 2019, 04:47:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Why Twitter (TWTR) Stock Looks Like a Buy Ahead of Q4 Earnings Thursday,"
 Twitter TWTR  shares jumped over 2% Monday, along with Apple AAPL  , Microsoft MSFT  , and other tech standouts. Despite its recent climb, shares of Twitter rest well below their 52-week high. So let's see why Twitter looks like a buy heading into the company's fourth-quarter earnings release Thursday.  Quick Overview  Twitter, like Facebook FB  , has dealt with backlash over the company's role in the spread of misinformation and ""fake news."" CEO Jack Dorsey and the company have cleaned up Twitter and tried to rid the social media platform of fake user accounts and ""prioritize the health of the platform."" This did hurt the company's user metrics last quarter, with its monthly active user totals down 4 million year-over-year and 9 million quarter-over-quarter. Despite some of the setbacks, Twitter posted its fourth straight quarter of GAAP profitability in Q3. Meanwhile, Twitter's total ad engagements surged 50% and cost per engagement sunk 14%. These two metrics could signal that  TWTR  is headed in the right direction since advertising accounted for 86% of revenue in Q3. Going forward, Twitter is likely to remain attractive to advertisers because the social media platform has become a place where millions of people consume information, from breaking news to entrainment. Plus, as non-ad supported platforms like Amazon Prime AMZN  and Netflix NFLX  grow, marketers will need to reach consumers somewhere. Twitter has also actively expanded its own live streaming video offerings through deals with dozens of media outlets such as ESPN DIS  . With all that said, owning  Twitter stock  has been no easy ride since the firm went public in 2013. Shares of Twitter have, however, bounced back over the last few years and are up 36% in the past 12 months. Twitter stock rested at roughly $34 a share Monday, which marks a 29% downturn from its 52-week high and might set up a solid buying opportunity for those high on the social media firm.       Q4 Outlook  Twitter's Q4 revenues are projected to jump by 19.14% to reach $871.59 million, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. This would mark a slowdown from Q3's 29% top-line expansion but crush the year-ago period's 2% revenue growth. For the full year, Twitter's revenues are projected to jump roughly 25% to reach $3.01 billion.  At the bottom end of the income statement, Twitter's adjusted fourth-quarter earnings are projected to surge 31.6% to reach $0.25 per share. On top of that, the company's full-year earnings are projected to skyrocket nearly 82%, driven in part by the third quarter's 110% bottom-line climb.  Details & Users  Moving on, let's take a look at what investors should expect from some of Twitter's vital company metrics, with the help of our NFM estimates. The company's total quarterly advertising revenue is expected to pop just over 18% to reach $760.34 million. TWTR's growing data licensing business is projected to surge roughly 24% and hit $107.87 million. Twitter's worldwide MAU total is expected to come in at 319.05 million in Q4, which would mark a decline of 11 million users or 3.3% from the fourth-quarter of 2017. Investors should also note that our NFM estimate would represent a 7 million sequential decline as the company's fake user cleanup rolls on.     Bottom Line  Twitter is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at the moment based on its recen t earnings  estimate revision trends that also sports a ""B"" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. The company is scheduled to release its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 financial results before the opening bell on Thursday, February 7. So, make sure to come back to Zacks for a complete breakdown of the firm's actual Q4 results.

Quick Overview  Twitter, like Facebook FB  , has dealt with backlash over the company's role in the spread of misinformation and ""fake news."" CEO Jack Dorsey and the company have cleaned up Twitter and tried to rid the social media platform of fake user accounts and ""prioritize the health of the platform."" This did hurt the company's user metrics last quarter, with its monthly active user totals down 4 million year-over-year and 9 million quarter-over-quarter.
Q4 Outlook  Twitter's Q4 revenues are projected to jump by 19.14% to reach $871.59 million, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate.
For the full year, Twitter's revenues are projected to jump roughly 25% to reach $3.01 billion.
At the bottom end of the income statement, Twitter's adjusted fourth-quarter earnings are projected to surge 31.6% to reach $0.25 per share.
Twitter's worldwide MAU total is expected to come in at 319.05 million in Q4, which would mark a decline of 11 million users or 3.3% from the fourth-quarter of 2017.

By Paresh Dave and Arjun Panchadar
Feb 4 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc reported sharply higher fourth-quarter spending on video content, employees and facilities, worrying investors who sent the tech company's shares down about 3 percent after hours on Monday. 
Google's parent company beat Wall Street's estimates for revenue and profit, but the bigger-than-expected spending prompted investors to question whether cash funneled into Alphabet's newer businesses will generate the returns that its search engine unit historically has. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
The company reported $31.07 billion in total fourth-quarter costs and expenses, up 26 percent from last year. Capital expenditures rose 64 percent compared to last year, up to $7.08 billion.
Spending was pushed higher by Google boosting staffing on its cloud computing division, promoting its consumer devices and YouTube subscription packages and acquiring office buildings in Silicon Valley and New York City.
Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told analysts that capital expenditures would moderate significantly this year, but the company would continue to invest in long-term bets on artificial intelligence services, consumer hardware and emerging markets.   


REVENUE, PROFIT BEATS 
Alphabet's fourth-quarter revenue rose 22 percent from a year ago to $39.28 billion, compared with Wall Street's average estimate of $38.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. About 83 percent of the revenue came from Google's ad system.
Heavy advertising in the run-up to the holiday shopping season boosted sales. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai told analysts the number of people shopping on Google.com each day during the holidays doubled over last year. 
Profit for the quarter was $8.95 billion, or $12.77 per share, compared with a $3 billion loss a year ago. That beat analysts'average estimates of $7.69 billion, or $10.87 per share.
Partly because of the higher spending, Alphabet's operating margin was 21 percent, down from 24 percent in the year-ago period.
""For a growth company, investment should be applauded,"" said Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell. ""But a lot of the additional expenditure is going into cloud where it is unclear whether there will ever be a return on that investment.""     Google remains behind rival Amazon.com Inc  in the cloud, said Cordwell. 
The company has authorized a plan to buy back an additional $12.5 billion worth of its shares, Porat said.


NO NEWS ON WAYMO
Google's mostly free search, video and productivity tools are used by billions of people across the world, despite a backlash in some countries over how the company uses and protects customer information. 
Investors concerned that Alphabet's future growth, especially in emerging markets, will not match its previous rates, are looking to the company's other businesses to provide new streams of revenue. But Alphabet gave away little new information on its other ventures on Monday.
It gave no indication when its self-driving car company Waymo will generate noticeable revenue. In October, Alphabet said Waymo had begun revenue-generating rides within a small section of Arizona but did not break out the company's financials. 
Pichai said Google's cloud computing unit last year doubled the number of deals it struck worth more than $1 million. The cloud unit's G Suite productivity product now has 5 million customers, he said, up from 4 million in last year's first quarter.

Apple andMicrosoft's gains helped S&P 500 technology stocks .SPLRCT gain 1.6 percent, the greatest rise among the benchmark index'smajor sectors.
High expectations for Alphabet Inc'sGOOGL.O quarterlyresults, announced after the bell, were likely a contributor totech and internet stocks' advance during market hours, saidMichael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading inGreenwich, Connecticut.
Yet in after-hours trading, Alphabet shares fell more than 2percent. While its fourth-quarter revenue and profit beat WallStreet's expectations, spending grew more than expected. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL3N1ZZ43M
FAANG earnings have been a mixed bag. Shares of Apple andFacebook Inc FB.O rose after those companies' quarterlyresults, while downbeat forecasts from Netflix IncNFLX.O andAmazon.com Inc AMZN.O dragged down those companies' shares.  
Continued optimism regarding a possible trade truce betweenthe United States and China also boosted tech shares, said ShawnCruz, manager of trading strategy at TD Ameritrade in JerseyCity, New Jersey.

U.S. stocks have been lifted so far thisyear by the Federal Reserve's resolve to be ""patient"" withfurther interest rate hikes in addition to signs of progress inU.S.-China trade talks.

The next tech titan to step up to the plate is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ), which reports tonight after the bell.makeArticleAd(); Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.05% and S&P 500 futures are lower by 0.06%. Nasdaq-100 futures have lost 0.1%.In the options pits, call volume won the day, if only slightly. Overall volume levels remained near average levels. Specifically, about 19.2 million calls and 17.6 million puts changed hands on the session.Moving to the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio popped to 0.6. Meanwhile, the 10-day moving average ticked higher to 0.63.Here were three stocks landing atop the most-actives list.

Cronos Group (NASDAQ: CRON ) shares were flying high following upbeat comments during the earnings conference call of its largest shareholder, Altria (NYSE: MO ). Finally, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM ) jumped on a better-than-expected earnings report of its own.Let's take a closer look:Amazon (AMZN)After Thursday's closing bell, Amazon delivered earnings per share of $6.04 on a record $72.4 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter. While both measures bested the Street's estimates, forward guidance left much to be desired. Traders anchored on the second piece of news and sent AMZN shares down 5.38% by day's end.10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your PortfolioWith the slide, Amazon stock has returned to no-man's land. It remains sandwiched between a sideways moving 200-day and 50-day moving average. One silver lining to the stalemate is it's providing clear levels to trade off of. Watch for a break of either $1,600 or $1,730 to signal the direction of its next move.On the options trading front, calls outpaced puts by a modest margin despite the day's drubbing. Total activity ramped to 239% of the average daily volume with 431,513 contracts traded. Calls contributed 55% to the total.Heading into the number, option premiums were pricing in a 5% move.

Exxon Mobil reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.41 per share on revenue of $71.90 billion.XOM stock rallied 3.6% on heavy volume.

Activity ballooned to 359% of the average daily volume, with 114,763 total contracts traded. Calls added 73% to the day's tally.Friday's 3.6% rally exceeded market expectations.

106,"February 04, 2019, 08:30:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Will Google-Parent Alphabet Top or Flop in Q4?,"
 Google-parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL  is set to report fourth-quarter results later today. Alphabet's earnings adjusted for one-time factors have significantly surpassed Wall Street's expectations in all the three reported quarters of 2018. Thus, a good earnings result for the final quarter of 2018 should certainly impress investors, but, the task won't be easy for the company's management this time around.  Tougher Growth Trajectory  Alphabet has spent millions of dollars on marketing digital ads in the fourth quarter. Still, it was difficult for the tech giant to maintain revenue growth despite a healthy U.S. economy and steady rise in consumer outlays. Rising costs to bring in more sales, in fact, have been haunting Alphabet for quite some time. Alphabet has invested a lot in building data centers to develop and market new consumer hardware like Pixel phones. Alphabet's sales from its own properties, including YouTube and search pages, have increased 22% and were lower than the 26% growth reported in the prior quarter. And if this downward trend continued in the fourth quarter, it will surely affect the company's shares, which closed at $1,118.62 on Feb 1. Needless to say, the company's stock is struggling due to the ongoing social media data hullabaloo and regulatory scrutiny across the sector.  The Bright Side  Alphabet's sales and its outlook might improve on its success in the lucrative cloud computing market. Lest we forget, Alphabet's 'other revenue' bucket that does include the cloud along with hardware and app sales, grew 29% during the third quarter. Alphabet now holds the third position in the cloud business, behind Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN  and Microsoft Corporation MSFT  . Investors should see upbeat results from Alphabet's other business lines, including the self-driving car unit. Waymo, a unit of Alphabet, had launched its first driverless-car service in Arizona last December and vowed to proceed ""carefully"" with the technology. In the future, Waymo will ""gradually roll out"" the driverless car program and the early-rider program will continue. The early-rider program included more than 400 Phoenix-area residents signing up last year to test drive driverless cars in their neighborhood. While Waymo, the self-driving business, may not have significantly boosted revenues in the fourth quarter, executives will certainly discuss its likely positive effects on the company's earnings.       Will Alphabet be Able to Trounce Expectations   Again?  Alphabet's competitive advantage and growth in its cloud computing and driverless car segments should have a positive impact on its earnings. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is widely expected to report $11.08 o f earnings  per share for the fourth quarter, higher than $9.70 reported a year ago. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .      The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current fiscal year earnings has moved up 0.2% in the past 60 days.       makeArticleAd();  But, for the company's shares to gain traction in the near term, Alphabet needs to show that the new segments of growth such as cloud computing and driverless car are contributing more toward revenue than its ad business. The company has underperformed the broader industry so far this year (+7.0% vs +11.1%).         Nonetheless, its earnings growth for the current year is widely expected to come in at 31.1%, way higher than the Internet - Services  industry's projected growth of 0.7%.

108,"February 04, 2019, 07:07:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Should iShares Russell Top 200 ETF (IWL) Be on Your Investing Radar?,"
 Launched on 09/22/2009, the iShares Russell Top 200 ETF (IWL) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market. The fund is sponsored by Blackrock. It has amassed assets over $204 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.  Why Large Cap Blend  Large cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies. Blend ETFs usually hold a mix of growth and value stocks as well as stocks that exhibit both value and growth characteristics.  Costs  Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same. Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.15%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space. It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.79%.  Sector Exposure and Top Holdings  Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 20.90% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three. Looking at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 4.50% of total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN). The top 10 holdings account for about 25.7% of total assets under management.  Performance and Risk  IWL seeks to match the performance of the Russell Top 200 Index before fees and expenses. The Russell Top 200 Index is a float-adjusted, capitalization-weighted index that measures the performance of the largest capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market. The ETF return is roughly 7.50% so far this year and is down about -1.82% in the last one year (as of 02/04/2019). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $54.65 and $68.21. The ETF has a beta of 0.99 and standard deviation of 12.66% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 198 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.  Alternatives  IShares Russell Top 200 ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, IWL is a sufficient option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $154.26 B in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $251.87 B. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.04% and SPY charges 0.09%.  Bottom-Line  Retail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

By Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI, Feb 4 (Reuters) - State-developer Dubai South said on Monday it aimed to spend two billion dirhams ($545 million) to build an e-commerce free trade zone offering foreign firms 100 percent ownership.
Foreigners operating outside of free trade zones in Dubai and the wider United Arab Emirates can usually only hold a maximum 49 percent stake, with UAE nationals holding the rest.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Dubai is already the headquarters of the region's largest e-commerce company, Souq.com, which was bought by Amazon  in 2017. It is also home to noon.com, an online shopping site set up by Dubai billionaire Mohammed Alabbar
Dubai South aimed to invest two billion dirhams over four years in the zone, although the timeline for spending the cash would depend on demand, the logistics district head for Dubai South, Mohsen Ahmad, told Reuters.
Ahmad said the funds, which Dubai South planned to raise from banks and other institutions, would be spent on infrastructure, offices and warehouses.
EZDubai will be located in the south of the emirate near industrial and residential developments and Dubai's second airport, Al Maktoum International.

By Karin Strohecker
LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - World stocks remained near two-month highs on Monday with the dollar and oil chalking up gains, though some European bourses struggled as momentum from last week's U.S. employment and manufacturing data bounce started to fade.
The pan-European STOXX 600  slipped 0.1 percent in early trading with Paris's CAC  and Frankfurt's DAX  both falling around 0.2-0.3 percent.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
London's FTSE  rose 0.2 percent to a two-month high after sterling softened against the dollar. 
Trade was subdued with many of the region's markets closed for the Lunar New Year. China's financial markets are closed all week, while those in South Korea are shut until Thursday.
""The tone we took away from the end of last week and the dovish tilt from the Federal Reserve is positive for risk assets,"" Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London.
""The benign outlook for monetary policy should support risk assets but the elephants in the room are Brexit, trade talks and political instability in Europe,"" Hewson said, adding he expected Tuesday's services PMI data to confirm a darkening picture for Europe.
U.S. stock market futures also pointed to a more muted start to the week: S&P 500 and Nasdaq e-mini futures,  both traded a touch softer.
On Wall Street on Friday, optimism from a surge in January U.S. job growth was offset by a disappointing outlook from Amazon.com Inc  battering retail stocks. The Dow  rose 0.26 percent while the Nasdaq  shed 0.25 percent.
Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls jumped by a stronger-than-forecast 304,000 jobs in January - the largest gain since February 2018.  That report, along with better-than-expected January ISM manufacturing activity numbers, pointed to underlying strength in the world's biggest economy.
However, global equity markets performed strongly last week after the Federal Reserve pledged to be patient with further interest rate hikes, signalling a potential end to its tightening cycle.
Meanwhile in FX markets, the dollar index  extended gains for a third straight day, strengthening 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies.
Against the yen, the dollar climbed a third of a percent to 109.89 yen  while euro was slightly lower at $1.1447  after getting pulled back from Friday's high of $1.1488 on Friday.
But analysts were watching closely how long the momentum in the dollar could last.
""Overall, the emergence of stronger than expected U.S. economic data should help to ease downside risks for the US dollar in the near-term following the recent dovish shift in Fed policy,"" Lee Hardman at MUFG Bank wrote in a note to clients.
""However, it is unlikely to prove sufficient to trigger a sustained turn around for the U.S. dollar.""
On the day, China's yuan  suffered some of the biggest losses against the dollar, weakening 0.4 percent in offshore trading. The latest falls took the losses of the yuan over the past two days to more than 1 percent - falls last seen in August last year when a broader selloff hammered emerging market assets.
The tumble came despite data showing that China's sprawling services sector maintained a solid pace of expansion in January albeit at a slower pace, offering continued support for the world's second-largest economy as manufacturing cools.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 2.702 percent  after climbing nearly 6 basis points on Friday to pull away from a four-week low of 2.619 percent hit earlier last week.
In the commodity market, spot gold  fell more than half a percent to $1,310.88, moving away from a more than 9-month high of $1,326.30 reached last week.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) U.S. crude oil futures  rose 0.3 percent to $55.43 a barrel while Brent crude futures  added 0.7 percent to $63.19.
On Friday, WTI futures had rallied 2.7 percent on the upbeat U.S. job report, signs that Washington's sanctions on Venezuelan exports have helped tighten supply and data showing U.S. drillers cut the number of oil rigs.

Australian shares  ended half a percent higher, as  did Japan's Nikkei.
U.S. S&P 500 e-mini futures  last traded basically flat.
On Wall Street on Friday, optimism from a surge in January U.S. job growth was offset by a weaker-than-expected outlook from Amazon.com Inc  that battered retail stocks. The Dow  nudged up 0.26 percent while the Nasdaq  shed 0.25 percent. 
""Key points for the markets this week will be how the remaining U.S. corporate earnings releases turn out, and whether they are in line with recent upbeat data,"" said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
""While corporate earnings and fundamentals remain key, political developments, notably the U.S.-China trade situation, remain potential risk factors.""
China's sprawling services sector maintained a solid pace of expansion in January even though growth moderated slightly, a private survey showed on Sunday, offering continued support for the world's second-largest economy as manufacturing cools.
A U.S. Labor Department report on Friday showed nonfarm payrolls jumped by a stronger-than-forecast 304,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since February 2018.
That report, along with better-than-expected ISM manufacturing activity numbers for January, pointed to underlying strength in the world's biggest economy.
""After last week's risk appetite revival, the data pulse and the tone of Fed speakers will be important. For the Goldilocks market to continue, we need to find a delicate balance between improving data and still-neutral central banks,"" strategists at ANZ wrote.
Global equity markets performed strongly last week after the Federal Reserve pledged to be patient with further interest rate hikes, signalling a potential end to its tightening cycle.
Friday's robust economic data triggered a sharp rebound in U.S. Treasury yields, in turn lifting the dollar.
On Monday, the U.S. currency climbed a quarter of a percent to 109.76 yen, after advancing 0.6 percent on Friday.
The euro was slightly lower at $1.1442  after getting pulled back from a high of $1.1488 on Friday.
The Australian dollar dropped 0.2 percent to $0.7230, falling a second session after slipping 0.4 percent on Friday.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 2.695 percent  after climbing nearly 6 basis points on Friday to pull away from a four-week low of 2.619 percent hit earlier last week.
In the commodity market, spot gold  fell nearly half a percent to $1,312.60, moving away from a more than 9-month high of $1,326.30 reached last week.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) U.S. crude oil futures  gave up some of last week's gains and were last down 8 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $55.19 a barrel.
On Friday, WTI futures had rallied 2.7 percent on the upbeat U.S. job report, signs that Washington's sanctions on Venezuelan exports have helped tighten supply and data showing U.S. drillers cut the number of oil rigs. 
Brent crude futures  were last up 3 cents, or 0.05 percent, at $62.78.

122,"February 03, 2019, 06:03:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Netflix's Hidden Price Hike,"
  Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) just raised prices. Customers hated it.   Investors loved it.    It caused a stir, and then it faded away -- and, if patterns   hold, it should be at least a year or two before we see Netflix   hike prices again. But that doesn't mean that customers won't   find themselves paying more for Netflix over the coming months   and years. Trends suggest Netflix's customer base will create an   invisible price increase of its own, one that will matter to   Netflix in 2019, 2020, and beyond.   Image source: Getty Images. makeArticleAd(); Netflix's service tiers To understand what might happen, we need to understand   Netflix's price tiers.       Basic Tier   Standard Tier   Premium Tier    Price $8.99 $12.99 $15.99   Select features Standard definition, one screen at a time High definition, two screens at a time  4K Ultra HD, four screens at a time    Data source: Netflix. Netflix's most popular plan is its standard plan, which offers   multiple streams -- useful for families -- and 1080p   high-definition streaming. The basic plan is quite limited in an   era when standard definition feels quaint, especially since it   limits things to just one stream (not likely to be popular among   the more than 70% of people who share subscription passwords for   services like Netflix). Then there is the premium plan. It offers additional streams   and 4K Ultra HD streaming quality. That 4K Ultra HD is   increasingly becoming the norm in the TV and streaming   marketplace. The rise of 4K Ultra HD 4K Ultra HD is the latest and greatest mainstream high-def   format. Like its predecessors 720p and 1080p, 4K is named after   its pixel count: 4,000, though pedants will note that this figure   is rounded up from the more accurate 3,840 and refers to pixels   along the long side; the numbers 720 and 1,080 were taken from   the short side. Whatever the details, though, 4K is the best HD   the typical consumer can buy. Its eventual replacement, 8K, was a   novelty at tech trade show CES this year and is not expected to   make much of a consumer splash anytime in the next couple of   years. The CES debut of 4K came way back in 2012. Consumer models   that followed were pricey, and 4K -- like all fancy new TV   technology -- took a while to go from novelty to industry   standard. But we're there. TVs with 4K are way down in price since 2012.   Once in the thousands of dollars, they now sell in the hundreds.   This technology is not just for early adopters and conspicuous   consumers anymore. Streaming devices are following suit:   Roku    (NASDAQ: ROKU) and   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN)    battled in the low-cost 4K streaming market    this past Christmas season. And more and more streaming services   offer 4K streaming as a standard feature or (as Netflix does) as   a premium-tier perk. There is little reason for any consumer with the means to buy   a 4K TV to opt for anything less, and that's been true for a few   years now. And when owners of new 4K TVs fire up Netflix, they   want to see 4K video. That's possible only with Netflix's premium   plan. Netflix's ideal upsell situation Netflix's most popular plan does not deliver the high-def   format that is now the industry standard. That's a reason for   subscribers to upgrade, and Netflix knows it: Fire up standard   Netflix on a new 4K Roku TV, and a pop-up box will suggest that   you upgrade to Premium right then and there. Do consumers make the jump? Studies suggest that they do. The   most recent Parks Associates study of Netflix's tiers, released   in summer of 2018, showed a significant increase in the number of   premium subscribers year over year. The number of basic   subscribers, meanwhile, seems to be shrinking.     Pricing Tier   Q3 2017 Share of Netflix Subscribers   Q1 2018 Share of Netflix Subscribers    Basic 35% 27%   Standard 44% 43%   Premium 21% 30%    Data source: Park Associates. Assuming that account-sharing habits are not undergoing a   massive shift, this change must be driven by streaming quality.   As new high-definition formats become standard, Netflix's   standard-def plan begins to look like a relic -- and its 4K plan   begins to look like less of an extravagance. 4K and the future of Netflix There are ways that this trend could be disrupted, of course.   Netflix could add 4K streaming to its standard pricing, using its   recent price hike to subsidize the new feature (4K streaming does   cost Netflix more, because larger 4K files demand more server   space and upload bandwidth). But if current trends hold, more   customers will move up the rungs of Netflix's pricing structure   between regular price increases.   10 stocks we like better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

125,"February 03, 2019, 12:00:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Stock Market Power Rankings: Apple Jacks,"
 Each week, I'm   ranking the biggest companies    that trade on U.S. exchanges based on their size (   market capitalization    ), momentum (total return over the past year), and recent news.   Before we get to the rankings, a quick word on a major   player. One of this past week's biggest winners was   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) . The consumer-tech giant announced its fiscal   first-quarter results, and investors were relieved that things   could've been worse. Apple isn't at its best right now. It suffered a 15% decline   in iPhone revenue, and since smartphone average selling prices   keep inching higher, we're talking about a much larger drop in   the number of iPhones sold. Apple also continues to struggle in   China, once an important part of the bullish buy thesis for the   stock.makeArticleAd(); The good news is that its services revenue continues to be a   bright spot. Apple is also experiencing a surge in iPad   popularity, coming through with its   strongest growth in tablets    in nearly six years. There are still some near-term concerns   here, but the out-of-favor stock managed to clean up nicely for a   very importan   t earnings    report. With that in mind, let's review this week's updated list of 50   top large-cap stocks, kicking things off with the top 10.   Image source: Getty Images.  This week's top 10 stocks  10. Walmart    (NYSE: WMT) : $272.7 billion, down 11.1% over the past year. The world's largest retailer turned heads last summer, when it   closed on its $16 billion purchase of a controlling stake in   Indian e-tail giant Flipkart, but now it may be paying an even   bigger price. New foreign investment restrictions in India could   limit e-commerce sites from selling items by companies that they   have an equity interest in or that demand platform exclusivity.   Flipkart seemed like a smart way for Walmart to scale its online   business in the world's second most populous market, but now some   are wondering how many products Flipkart will have to stop   selling and if Walmart will have to write down the value of its   investment.  9. Pfizer    (NYSE: PFE) : $247.9 billion, up 16.4%. The pharmaceuticals giant beat Wall Street forecasts on both   ends of the income statement, but the guidance it initiated for   the year ahead wasn't as kind. Pfizer sees a profit per share of   $2.82 to $2.92 on $52 billion to $54 billion in revenue for all   of 2019. Analysts were modeling earnings of $3.04 a share on   $54.4 billion in revenue. However, the mixed showing didn't stop   at least two firms from upgrading the stock on favorable product   news.  8. Alibaba    (NYSE: BABA) : $435.4 billion market cap, down 12.6%. China's leading online marketplace continues to grow in   popularity, and Alibaba posted solid growth in its latest   quarter. Despite fears of an economic slowdown in China,   consumers are still flocking to online outlets to find great   deals. Alibaba now has 636 million annual active customers on its   platform, 35 million more than it had just three months   earlier.  7. Facebook    (NASDAQ: FB) : $472.9 billion market cap, down 14.2%. The social-networking leader experienced the largest stock   gain among the top 10 this past week, soaring 11.2% after the   company came through with a better-than-expected quarter. Beating   revenue and profit goals is certainly healthy news, but the real   gem is that active user numbers are growing sequentially again.   Facebook's daily and monthly active users increased 9% on a   year-over-year basis, and there was also improvement from the   third quarter's showing. Other successes included topping 500   million daily active users for Instagram Stories and more than 90   million small businesses using its products.  6. Visa    (NYSE: V) : $307.9 billion, up 11.5%. The swipes keep coming for the world's leading credit card   company, which came through with better-than-expected financial   results for its fiscal first quarter on Wednesday. We're still   seeing low double-digit growth at Visa, as payment volume and the   number of processed transactions both rose 11% for the   holiday-containing quarter.  5. Berkshire Hathaway    (NYSE: BRK-A) : $515.2 billion, down 3.7%. There was no material news out of Warren Buffett's investing   empire, but it was a good week to have Apple as its largest stock   portfolio holding. Apple shares rose 5.6% higher for the week,   helping boost the value of Berkshire Hathaway's stock   portfolio.  4. Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)  (down from 3): $775.2   billion, down 5.3%. It will be Alphabet's turn to   step up to the earnings podium    on Monday. Analysts see the global search-engine champ clocking   in at nearly $39 billion for the holiday-containing fourth   quarter, 21% ahead of where it landed a year earlier. Earnings   growth is modeled at a slower 12% clip, but that's not a   deal-breaker. Google is making big bets on projects outside its   high-margin online advertising stronghold, and those aren't   expected to pay off on the bottom line anytime soon.  3. Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL)  (up from 4): $785.2 billion, down 0.8%. There are now more than 900 million iPhone users in the world,   a big number in theory but a complicated problem for Apple. This   past week's earnings report   inadvertently confirmed    that the lion's share of its shrinking iPhone sales are coming   from existing users who are upgrading earlier models. A loyal   audience is great, but with Apple smartphones growing more   expensive, it will be that much harder to woo new users who are   satisfied with much cheaper platforms.  2. Microsoft    (NASDAQ: MSFT) (down from 2): $788.6 billion, up 9%. The two top companies on this list saw their share prices   slide after they posted   poorly received quarterly results    , but Microsoft took the bigger hit, and now it's no longer on   top. The software behemoth's fiscal second quarter was in line   with expectations, but that's not going to be good enough for a   company that had spoiled investors by blowing through Wall Street   targets with ease over the past year.  1. Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN)  (up from 2): $798.8 billion, up 17%. The world's leading online retailer also stepped up with fresh   financials, and investors weren't impressed. Amazon came through   with a strong quarter, but uninspiring guidance for the current   period weighed on the enthusiasm. Several analysts lowered their   price targets on the stock following the report. There was   sluggishness at Whole Foods, and there are concerns about its   operations in India, given the new restrictions that are also   stinging Walmart. The rank and file We'll get to No. 11 through No. 50 in a moment, but first,   let's look at one of the other Top 50 stocks making waves, for   better or worse. The Golden Arches are making the most of improving work trends   and the explosion of food-delivery services, as   McDonald's    (NYSE: MCD) posted blowout financial results on Wednesday. Global   same-restaurant sales inched 4.4% higher. Closer to home, McDonald's is cashing in on its affiliation   with Uber Eats, making its fast-food menu more easily accessible   to folks willing to pay for the convenience of home and office   delivery. McDonald's has always had a strong breakfast game, and   that's benefiting from low unemployment numbers as commuters   flock to its drive-through lanes in the morning. Stocks 11 through 50  11.

BP    (NYSE: BP) : $138.3 billion, up 4%.  50. Starbucks    (NASDAQ: SBUX) : $84.7 billion, up 21.6%. Who's in and who's out BP and Starbucks are cracking into this week's list, with BP   making the cut for the first time since this feature began. BP is   the London-based gas and oil giant that's generating more than   $220 billion in annual sales, and Starbucks claws its way back   onto our list after posting big gains. The coffee king commands   the lowest market cap currently on the list, but it's hard to   ignore the stock's 21.6% pop over the past 52 weeks.  Toyota    (NYSE: TM) and   Costco    (NASDAQ: COST) are the two names that fell out. Toyota had a   rough January. Sales declined by 6.6% in the U.S., tripped up by   sluggish demand for its Camry and Prius models. Toyota's Prius   hybrid had its worst month of stateside sales in years. Costco is holding up relatively well, but it had the lowest   market cap on the list. Its single-digit gain over the past year   was no match for Starbucks and its caffeinated pop. One to watch One of the large caps that have yet to crack this ranked list   is   General Electric    (NYSE: GE) . A few years ago, it would've been blasphemous to not   include GE in any conversation of the most valuable companies,   but GE has hit hard times lately. GE's market cap was closing in on $600 billion during the   dot-com bubble days, and even a dozen years ago General Electric   was second to only ExxonMobil in terms of market cap. The stock   has taken a beating in recent years, and over the past year its   value has plunged 36% to fall below $100 billion. The stock surrendered roughly three-quarters of its value   through 2017 and 2018, but the market's welcome reaction to   its latest quarter    on Thursday could be the first sign of a turnaround. There are   still problems at GE, but strength in its aviation business and   signs of bottoming out elsewhere make GE a stock worth watching   again.   10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (A     shares)       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

126,"February 03, 2019, 11:14:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,3 Stocks I'm Never Selling,"
 When you think of investing with an eye toward never selling,   it makes you think differently. There are two things this   approach changes. First, you consider buying only shares of   companies that have impenetrable   competitive moats    . Second, because you're investing in companies with durable   competitive advantages, you don't worry about market volatility.   Wide-moat companies get stronger during tough economic times and   keep growing over the long term.  Brookfield Asset Management    (NYSE: BAM) ,   Mastercard    (NYSE: MA) , and   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) all have wide moats and are three stocks I plan on   holding for a long time. Let's take a closer look.   IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.makeArticleAd();  Diversify with hard assets Brookfield Asset Management is one of the world's largest   owners of infrastructure and real estate properties. The company   has $331 billion of assets under management, which it   invests in businesses that form the backbone of the global   economy. It owns 138 million square feet of total office space,   spanning some of the largest cities, and owns   businesses operating in every major industry, including   utilities, logistics, transportation, financial   services, and energy. A few of its prestigious real   estate properties include Canary Wharf in London and the   Atlantis hotel in the Bahamas. Its impressive portfolio of   assets churns out steady cash flow for the company to reinvest or   return to shareholders in the form o   f   dividends    and share repurchases. Brookfield's   modus operandi    is simple: Attract capital from institutional investors, and   invest that capital in high-quality assets when they're on   sale. Here are a few examples of the kinds of deals Brookfield is   known for. In 2009, Brookfield bought General Growth Properties,   one of the largest mall operators in the U.S., which was going   through bankruptcy because of previous management   mistakes. More recently, in the third quarter of 2018,   Brookfield acquired Westinghouse, one of the oldest electric   utility companies in the U.S., for $4 billion, and again out of   bankruptcy. Generally, Brookfield buys businesses where   management sees an opportunity to improve operations and squeeze   more profit out of the business over the long term. This   value-based approach has delivered handsome gains for   shareholders of 663% over the past 15 years, significantly   outperforming the   S&P 500    return of 144%. Brookfield is one of the few alternative asset managers in the   world capable of making multibillion-dollar deals, which means it   runs into less competition when an opportunity presents   itself. This advantage, coupled with management's   value-based approach, should deliver good returns for   shareholders for many years to come. A royalty on every card swipe Mastercard has been very consistent in its operating   performance, and that consistency has translated to impressive   gains of more than 4,000% for shareholders since the stock's IPO   more than 10 years ago. The company has   2.47 billion cards     active around the world and an irreplaceable   transaction network that allows the company to serve as a   tollbooth operator in the global economy. Every time someone uses   one of its cards at the checkout, Mastercard earns a fee. Mastercard is benefiting from a secular trend of the shifting   of global payments from cash to electronic forms. Revenue has   grown by 68% over the past five years. In the third quarter of   2018, revenue and operating income increased 15% and 19%,   respectively. Analysts expect the company to grow earnings   22% annually over the next five years. The company should be able to maintain this level of growth   for a long time, given that cash and checks still make up 80% of   all transactions. Obviously, management's primary focus is   to convert those cash payments into electronic ones. Given the   consistency and enormous long-term growth runway in front of the   company, Mastercard is a stock I don't want to sell. A growing legion of Amazonians Amazon is a personal pick. I started placing a few orders per   year on Amazon around 2002, and I kept buying more until I got to   the point of becoming a Prime member. Now I get regular monthly   shipments for all kinds of household essentials. My relationship   with Amazon has influenced my shopping behavior in just about   everything else, in that I try to buy everything online as much   as I can. It's estimated that Amazon had 100 million Prime members as of   last year, which is more than double the 40 million it had   achieved in early 2015. That's a growing list of 100 million   shoppers who are likely to be loyal Amazonians for life. Clearly,   millions of people are satisfied with Prime, even as Amazon has   increased the annual cost of being a Prime member from $79 to   $119. I also like how Amazon is leveraging the benefits of Prime by   offering special discounts in Whole Foods stores. I can see   Amazon eventually expanding other stores, including   Amazon Go    and Amazon bookstores around the country, offering special   discounts for Prime members who visit a store. Amazon generated $220 billion in revenue over the past year,   and those sales grew 37% year over year. And it's not done. There   are still so many ways I can see Amazon continuing to dominate,   from   gaming     to the   cloud     to   healthcare     and more -- and that's why I don't plan on ever selling my   shares.

127,"February 03, 2019, 09:30:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Is Microsoft's Biggest Growth Engine Losing Its Mojo?,"
  Microsoft    (NASDAQ: MSFT) had a mixed second quarter based on last week's   earnings report. Its revenue rose 12% annually to $32.5   billion, but that marked its slowest growth in four quarters and   missed expectations by $40 million. However, its non-GAAP net   income rose 14% to $8.6 billion, as its EPS rose 15% to $1.10 per   share -- which beat estimates by a penny. Microsoft expects its revenue to rise 10%-12% annually in the   third quarter, which matches analysts' expectations. Analysts   expect its earnings    to rise 7%. Those forecasts indicate that Microsoft's growth is   decelerating as its growth engines cool off. Microsoft's strongest growth engine over the past year was its   commercial cloud business, which generates most of its revenue   from Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM. However, several   components of that engine posted softer growth during the second   quarter.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Getty Images.  Taking apart the engine Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue rose 48% annually to $9   billion during the quarter and accounted for 31% of its top line.   That represents a slight acceleration from its 47% growth in the   first quarter, but remains below its 50%-plus growth rate in   2018.

Microsoft doesn't disclose exactly how much revenue comes from   each of its cloud services, it only reports year-over-year growth   rates. Azure, its infrastructure cloud platform, remains the   fastest-growing division -- but its growth clearly decelerated   over the past year.               Q2 2018   Q3 2018   Q4 2018   Q1 2019   Q2 2019     Azure revenue   98%   89%   85%   76%   76%     Year-over-year growth, constant currency. Source: Microsof   t quarterly   report    s. Azure is still growing at a faster rate than its main   competitor,   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) Web Services (AWS), which posted 45% sales   growth last quarter. But Azure has a lower market share than   AWS, so it could fall further behind if its growth peaks. Microsoft isn't worried Microsoft doesn't seem concerned about the year-over-year   deceleration in Azure's growth. During the conference call, CEO   Satya Nadella emphasized that Azure was the ""core platform""   that powers ""everything"" -- including Office 365 and Dynamics   365, the two other pillars of its commercial cloud business. The growth of those two businesses also decelerated over the   past year, although Dynamics' growth slightly accelerated during   the second quarter on more ""modular, extensible, and AI-driven""   offerings for its customers according to Nadella.

Simply put, Microsoft believes that it can keep leveraging the   strength of Windows, Office, Dynamics, and its other products to   tether more customers to Azure. Once they're locked in, Microsoft   can cross-sell other services to boost its commercial cloud   revenue. Microsoft also holds another key advantage against Amazon.   Brick-and-mortar retailers that were burned by Amazon are more   likely to partner with Microsoft, since they don't   want to support    Amazon's highest margin business. That's why Microsoft recently   added   Walmart    ,   Kroger    , and   Walgreens Boots Alliance    to its growing list of   retail partners    .   Image source: Getty Images.  Microsoft can lock in these customers by bundling together   Azure, Office 365, Dynamics, and other services in cost-effective   packages. Microsoft is also helping some of these partners build   ""smart retail"" platforms to counter Amazon's growing   brick-and-mortar presence. Furthermore, CFO Amy Hood noted that a ""significant   improvement"" in Azure's gross margin boosted the total gross   margin of its commercial cloud business by five percentage points   annually to 62% during the second quarter. This indicates that   Azure's slowdown was likely caused by cyclically slower demand   from enterprise customers, rather than a pricing war with AWS and   other competitors. Hood expects the commercial cloud business to remain ""strong""   in the third and fourth quarters, but warned that it could face   ""challenging"" comparisons to the previous year. In other words,   the cloud business will keep growing, but investors should expect   lower growth rates. No, Microsoft isn't losing its mojo Microsoft's Azure business remains healthy, and it's probably   the only cloud platform that scares Amazon. Amazon has a   first-mover's advantage, but Microsoft can leverage its dominance   of PC operating systems and productivity software, as well as   growing retail resentment against Amazon, to remain the   attractive alternative. Azure's year-over-year growth will likely decelerate in the   second half of 2019, but investors shouldn't panic. That growth   should stabilize over the long term and enable Microsoft to lock   more customers into its ever-expanding ecosystem.   10 stocks we like better than Microsoft       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 When   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) first launched its Prime service, it offered free   two-day shipping for $79 a year. At the time, that service was   novel, maybe even revolutionary. It made it possible for members   to order whatever they wanted without thinking about the cost of   shipping. That's still the top perk offered to Prime members, who now   pay $119 a year (or $12.99 a month). Free delivery isn't the only   benefit that comes with Prime. The service offers   streaming video    , free music, discounts at Whole Foods, and   various other discounts    . For many members, however, free two-day delivery on over 100   million items remains the biggest draw. If that's why you keep   signing up for another year, it might be worth considering   whether you're wasting your money. Here are some possible reasons   to drop the service.makeArticleAd();   The biggest Amazon Prime perk is free two-day shipping.     Image source: Amazon.  1. You don't use it often It's liberating not to have to think about paying shipping   fees. If you're the type of person who places Amazon orders as   soon as you notice you need something -- resulting in multiple   deliveries per week -- then it's clear you're getting a good   value for your $119 a year. Some people, however, have more ordering discipline. They make   lists and ponder whether to buy something online or in-store,   placing fewer digital orders, but larger ones. That type of   shopper might only want to pay for Prime if they order multiple   times per month. If you order less than that, you should consider other   benefits in the package. For example, if you order once or twice   a month, but watch Prime Video regularly or shop at Whole Foods   often, you're probably still getting a good value. 2. Walmart could replace it for you  Walmart    (NYSE: WMT) offers free two-day shipping on qualifying orders   over $35, without requiring any sort of membership fee. Its   selection is much smaller than Amazon's -- a few million items   compared to over 100 million -- but that may not matter to   you. Figuring out whether Walmart can replace Prime for you   requires doing a test. Attempt to make a switch to see if either   the $35 threshold or the selection causes you problems. You may   find that with some minor substitutions, Walmart's free service   works well enough without being too much of a sacrifice. 3. Your ordering habits have changed Back when Prime launched in 2005, books and CDs were still big   sellers. Now, many consumers have switched to digital solutions   for books and music. That may have changed how often you order   shipments from Amazon without you really noticing. If you're not buying household items from Amazon -- such as   groceries, toiletries, or cleaning products -- you may not be   taking regular advantage of the free shipping. It's also possible   that you have switched some of your ordering to other services   like Instacart,   Target    's same-day delivery offering, or even Walmart's curbside   pickup. Do an audit Paying for something you don't use doesn't make sense. If   you're on the fence, consider your options. For one, you could   shift more of your shopping to Amazon to better get your money's   worth. That's not a bad idea, since the online retailer offers   both convenience and good pricing. The other option, of course, is to drop Prime. Amazon still   offers free shipping on orders of $35 or more -- they just won't   necessarily arrive in two days. It's not always an easy choice,   but you should only pay for Prime if it clearly offers you $119 a   year in value -- and for some people, it just won't.

  Expectations were high    going into   Amazon.com    's (NASDAQ: AMZN) fourth-quarter earnings report. The company had   reported a   record-breaking holiday season    in late December, fueling hopes for a better-than-expected   quarter. That's exactly what happened, but decelerating growth   gave investors pause.  Amazon   report    ed net sales of $72.4 billion, an increase of 20% year over year   and up 21% if you exclude the unfavorable impact from   year-over-year changes in foreign-exchange rates. This came in   just shy of the high end of management's forecast, which topped   out at $72.5 billion, and comfortably ahead of analysts'   consensus estimate of $71.87 billion.   Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();  Strength across the board Operating income of $3.8 billion easily exceeded Amazon's   guidance of $2.1 billion to $3.6 billion. Net income totaled $3   billion and earnings per share reached $6.04, up 61% year over   year. Excluding a one-time credit in Q4 2017 related to the U.S.   Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Amazon's profit nearly tripled last   quarter. There was solid growth across Amazon's operating segments.   North American e-commerce sales grew 18% year over year, to   $44.12 billion, while international sales of $20.83 billion   increased 15% compared to the prior-year quarter. Amazon Web   Services continued to post the most robust growth, as revenue   from the cloud-computing segment jumped 45% year over year, to   $7.43 billion. Each of the business segments also   improved their operating margins    . In North America, Amazon's operating margin increased from 4.5%   to 5.1% year over year. In the international market, operating   margin improved from negative 5.1% to negative 3.1%, as Amazon   continued to expand. Lastly, AWS continues to scale, and its   operating margin increased to 29.3% from 26.5% a year   earlier.

Chart by author. YOY = year over   year. Other areas of interest There were other interesting tidbits hidden within the bowels   of Amazon's massive financial report. Amazon's ""other"" revenue,   which consists primarily of advertising, soared to $3.39 billion,   up 95% year over year and   topping $10 billion for the year    . Subscription revenue -- which includes fees from Amazon Prime   memberships, as well as digital video, digital music, audiobook,   and e-book subscriptions -- grew 25% year over year to nearly $4   billion, and exceeded $14 billion for the year. Amazon reported that sales at physical stores declined by 3%   year over year, but that requires some context. First, when the   company changed Whole Foods' fiscal calendar to match Amazon's,   it added an additional five days to the prior-year quarter,   making for a tough year-over-year comparison. Furthermore, orders   via Prime that are picked up at Whole Foods aren't counted as   physical-store sales. Adjusting for these anomalies, sales at   Whole Foods increased by 6% year over year. Finally, Alexa and Echo devices continue to be a perennial   favorite of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who gave a nod to the   company's voice-activated products in the press release. ""Echo   Dot was the best-selling item across all products on Amazon   globally, and customers purchased millions more devices from the   Echo family compared to last year,"" Bezos wrote. He went on to   point out that the number of Alexa skills now tops 80,000, and   the team of scientists working on Alexa and   machine learning    more than doubled in 2018.   Image source: Amazon.  A look ahead For the upcoming first quarter, Amazon is guiding for revenue   in a range of $56 billion to $60 billion, which would represent   growth of between 10% and 18% year over year. The company expects   operating income to rise 21% to 74% compared to the prior-year   quarter, reaching a range of $2.3 billion to $3.3 billion. So why did Amazon's stock price fall after i   t report    ed earnings? Amazon grew revenue by 43%, 39%, and 29% year over   year in   the first    ,   second    , and   third quarters    of 2018, respectively. The company's 20% growth in the fourth   quarter represented its third consecutive quarter of decelerating   year-over-year revenue growth. With its first quarter revenue   growth outlook topping out at 18%, Amazon seems to be   acknowledging that the trend will continue. The falling stock   price reflects investors' concerns that Amazon's high-growth days   may be in the rear-view mirror. Given the gargantuan size of Amazon's business, it's   inevitable that growth will slow. However, it's important to   remember that Amazon continues to build out its cloud-computing   service, increase its lineup of voice-controlled digital   products, expand its international operations, and grow its   advertising business. Taken together, this illustrates the   significant opportunities that are ahead for Amazon, even in the   face of decelerating growth.

130,"February 02, 2019, 06:04:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Better Buy: Amazon.com vs Alphabet,"
  Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) is arguably the biggest competitor for   Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) . The two companies vie for   valuable   product searches    ,   digital advertising    ,   smart-speaker sales    , and public   cloud computing    contracts. Alphabet has even launched its own digital shopping   mall by partnering with other retailers to compete against   Amazon's core retail business. It's hard to go wrong with either Amazon or Alphabet, but   investors trying to decide between the two stocks may have a   tough time. Let's take a closer look at the ways that they   compare to help determine whether Alphabet or Amazon is the   better buy.   Image source: AmazonmakeArticleAd();   Two megatrends driving growth  Alphabet is the market leader in the rapidly growing digital   advertising market. Global digital ad sales increased about 17%   in 2018, according to   Magna Global    . The relatively mature U.S. market remains a strong source of   growth, keeping pace with the rest of world (16.6%). Search and   video advertising, two areas where Alphabet is a major force,   grew 16% and 29%, respectively, in 2018. Magna expects growth in digital ad sales to slow to 13% this   year. It previously forecast global digital ad spend would reach   $348 billion in 2022, implying a compound annual growth rate of   just 8.5% over the next four years. That estimate will likely go   up after 2018's better-than-expected results. Meanwhile, online commerce is fueling Amazon's growth. Global   e-commerce sales increased an estimated 23% in 2018, according to   eMarketer. That growth is expected to slow slightly to 18% in   2021. Growth is slower in the more mature U.S. market, where   Amazon dominates. U.S. online commerce grew an estimated 15.6% in   2018, but is projected to slow to 13.3% growth in 2022. So, Amazon's core business is growing at about the same rate   as Alphabet's, arguably even faster. It's also worth noting that   Amazon is gaining market share in key geographies like the U.S.   and   India    (although it faces risks from regulation in the latter).   Meanwhile, Alphabet is losing share of the digital ad market to   smaller competitors, including Amazon.   Image source: Alphabet subsidiary Google.   Around the margins  Alphabet enjoys wide profit margins. The company posted a   28.2% operating margin on its core Google business in the third   quarter. By comparison, Amazon's operating margin is extremely thin.   Amazon generated an operating margin of 5.2% in the fourth   quarter and 5.3% for the full year. But the trend is in Amazon's favor. The company tripled   operating income in 2018 by expanding its margin 3 percentage   points. Google's core operating margin contracted about 2.8   percentage points in the third quarter. Amazon's expanding margin is driven by growth in Amazon Web   Services, its cloud computing division, and its digital   advertising sales. Alphabet also has a rapidly growing cloud   computing business, but the margin for the business is likely   lower than its core advertising business. Amazon is operating on   a much bigger scale, and AWS produced an operating margin of   28.4% last year. Alphabet's declining margin is driven by higher   traffic acquisition costs    and a greater portion of revenue coming from YouTube. Amazon is positioned to keep growing revenue at a faster pace   than Alphabet, and its expanding operating margin means it ought   to show significantly faster earnings growth.  Is Amazon worth the price?  Just because Amazon is more likely to keep growing its bottom   line at a faster pace than Alphabet doesn't necessarily make it a   better buy. It's always worth taking a look at the company's   relative valuations.       Amazon.com   Alphabet       EV/EBITDA   29.5   16.3     P/E (TTM)   80.8   42     Forward P/E   60   23.6     Data source: YCharts, Yahoo! Finance. Amazon is currently trading for around two to three times the   valuation of Alphabet. That means that investors ought to expect   Amazon to grow its earnings at least twice as fast as Alphabet   over the next few years. Based on the current trends at each company and within their   respective core markets, it's a fair assumption that Amazon can   continue expanding its operating margin while growing its top   line faster than Alphabet. That will likely result in bottom line   growth that significantly outpaces Alphabet's -- although the big   wildcard is how well Alphabet assets other than Google, such as   Waymo and its Other Bets segment, can add to overall   performance. Indeed, analysts currently expect Amazon to grow its earnings   per share about 44% per year over the next five years. By   comparison, they expect Alphabet to grow EPS about 16% per year.

131,"February 02, 2019, 11:00:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Amazon Prime Finds New Way to Test Entertainment Content,"
 A few years removed from being dismissed from the BBC's   long-running   Top Gear    driving enthusiast show and relocating to the   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Original   The Grand Tour    , hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May are   charting new waters once again. This time it's in the form of a   video game, developed by Amazon's own gaming development   studio. This is more than Amazon Prime simply trying to capitalize on   one of its more popular titles. After hours of research (I mean   gameplay), it's my conclusion that   The Grand Tour Game    is a fresh take on video games that could help further expand who   considers themselves a gamer and further deepen Amazon's reach   into everyday life.   Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();  How it works  The Grand Tour Game    is an extension of streaming television. Upon its release in   mid-January 2019, players were able to take part in the   adventures from the first episodes of seasons one and two of the   show. Upon the weekly release of   The Grand Tour    season three, which begins early in the year, a playable version   of each episode -- complete with Clarkson, Hammond, and May's   driving scenarios and other ""questionable behavior"" -- will   launch alongside it. Available on   Sony    's Playstation 4 and   Microsoft    's Xbox One, the release is a first in the world of gaming   and TV show binging. It's the first time gameplay ties in   seamlessly with scenes from a show, released in an episodic   manner live with the show's release -- allowing viewers to   virtually experience the adventures as seen on TV. It also   launched with a price tag of just $14.99 as a digital download on   Amazon.com. These days, many new marquee games run $60 upon   release. Why the discount? It could be that, besides being a first of   its kind, it's also Amazon Game Studios' first major release. As   such, the game mechanics might feel a little clunky to hard-core   gamers -- more akin to an arcade game experience at this point.   Of course, that may be by design to make it more palatable to the   casual video-game players Amazon is targeting. Content is also a   little sparse, but that will change as new weekly episodes upload   (seasons one and two had 13 and 11 episodes, respectively).   However, there's another reason the game sells so cheaply: It's   all about the Prime membership.   Gamers can take the McLaren P1 and the Porsche 918 for a lap     with the hosts of The Grand Tour. Image source: Amazon.  Entertainment vertical integration The integration of entertainment brands along multiple   business segments has been in the news a lot lately.   Walt Disney    (NYSE: DIS) often gets credit for doing it best with its Marvel   Cinematic Universe and   Star Wars     franchises -- selling new chapters in the sagas from movie   screen to TV screen (including TV streaming later this year), and   from theme park to merchandise. It's an engaging model for the   consumer, and a   powerfully profitable    one for Disney. But Amazon's latest trick in the entertainment   space is unique, one that could reach new audiences for its   fledgling video-game studio and convince more households to sign   up for Prime memberships to watch the show that goes with the   game. It's unlikely we'll see an Amazon-land theme park anytime   soon, but it's nonetheless an interesting way for Amazon to   leverage one of its most popular TV titles on Prime Video and get   more consumers into the Amazon ecosystem. Amazon Game Studios has   a few other titles in the works, including a massively   multiplayer online (MMO) game called   New World    and a sci-fi battle royale game called   Crucible    . With entertainment services reaching a tipping point where   vertical integration is possible, Amazon the retailer and Amazon   the movie and TV show production studio could also have plans for   the titles -- if they take off. Just a few years ago, the careers of   The Grand Tour    's hosts appeared to be headed for decline, but the power of   Amazon has catapulted them even higher. The video game is a new   way to engage audiences, and if it's successful, it could be a   template that Amazon and others make more use of in the   future.

132,"February 02, 2019, 10:48:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Microsoft Earnings Show Its Growth Is on Track,"
  Microsoft    (NASDAQ: MSFT) has been making plenty of headlines lately, as the   company has been signing a growing list of   high-profile retailers    to its Azure cloud-computing platform. This had investors   hoping for a better-than-expected earnings   report    -- something the company has been delivering   fairly regularly    . When Microsoft delivered results that were mostly in line with   expectations, the market gave a collective shrug and went about   its business. For its fiscal second quarter, which ended Dec. 31,    Microsoft   report    ed revenue of $32.5 billion, up 12% year over year, near the high   end of its forecast and edging past analysts' consensus estimates   of $32.49 billion. Operating income increased 18% compared with   the prior-year quarter, resulting in adjusted earnings per share   of $1.10, topping expectations of $1.09.   Image source: Microsoft.makeArticleAd();  Strength across the board Microsoft saw solid, though not spectacular, growth in each of   its major business segments. Productivity and business processes produced revenue of $10.1   billion, up 13% year over year. Within the segment, Office   commercial products and cloud services increased 11% year over   year, as Office 365 commercial revenue jumped 34%. LinkedIn was   also a bright spot, with revenue that grew 29% compared with the   prior-year quarter and generating record levels of engagement, as   sessions grew by 30%. Dynamics revenue increased 17%, driven by   Dynamics 365, which grew 51% year over year. Intelligent cloud revenue saw the most dramatic segment   growth, to $9.4 billion, up 20% year over year. Server products   and cloud services revenue grew 24% year over year, driven by   Azure cloud revenue growth of 76%. Enterprise services revenue   grew a more modest 6% compared with the prior-year quarter. A   number of larger, long-term contracts for Azure are   use-as-you-go, which will result in variation from quarter to   quarter. Revenue from The More Personal Computing segment saw more   modest growth, topping $13 billion, an increase of 7% year over   year. The highlight was revenue from the Surface tablet, which   increased 39% year over year, while gaming revenue climbed 8% and   search advertising grew 14% year over year. Windows OEM   disappointed, as revenue declined 5% year over year. Microsoft   said this was the result of constrained chip supply felt by its   partners, leading to lower sales. ""Our strong commercial cloud results reflect our deep and   growing partnerships with leading companies in every industry   including retail, financial services, and healthcare,"" said Satya   Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. ""We are delivering differentiated   value across the cloud and edge as we work to earn customer trust   every day.""   Image source: Microsoft.  Head in the clouds? Since cloud computing has become such an important component   to Microsoft's growth, it bears spending a moment to see how it   compares with its biggest rival -- and   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the undisputed leader in the space. Amazon Web Services (AWS) reported $25.6 billion over the   trailing-12-month period, up 47% year over year. Microsoft's   Intelligent Cloud segment clocked in at $36.6 billion over the   previous four quarters, up 21% year over year. It's important to   note that this isn't necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison,   as what's included in cloud revenue is likely different for each   company -- and neither provides enough granular detail to make   such a comparison. This unscientific approach appears to show   that, overall, Amazon's cloud segment is still growing   faster. A look ahead For the upcoming third quarter, Microsoft is forecasting   revenue in a range of $29.4 billion to $30.1 billion, a target   which, if met, would represent growth of between 9.7% and 12.3%   year over year. The company is also projecting cost of goods sold   of $10.45 billion and expenses of $10.15 billion, both at the   midpoint of its guidance. The company doesn't provide   earnings-per-share estimates. In the absence of more specific guidance, we can turn to Wall   Street, though we don't want to get caught up in its short-term   thinking. Analysts' consensus estimates are calling for revenue   of $29.88 billion -- near the high end of management's guidance   -- and earnings per share of $1.02. This was a solid, albeit somewhat unremarkable, quarter for   Microsoft. That's OK, though, because the company's growth is   still on track.   10 stocks we like better than Microsoft       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor      , has quadrupled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the      10 best stocks       for investors to buy right now... and Microsoft wasn't one of     them!

133,"February 01, 2019, 06:13:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,"Disney (DIS) Q1 Earnings Preview: Media Networks, Studio, Parks & More","
 Disney DIS  is scheduled to report its Q1 fiscal 2019 financial results after the closing bell on Tuesday, February 5. Shares of DIS have surged 11% since Christmas, along with giants like Facebook FB  and Google GOOGL  . Disney is also coming off a strong fourth quarter. So, let's see what to expect from the entertainment giant as it prepares to enter the streaming TV market to challenge Netflix NFLX  , Amazon AMZN  , AT&T T  , and Apple AAPL  .  Outlook  Disney's fiscal Q1 revenues are projected to slip 1.1% from the year-ago period to hit $15.18 billion. This would mark a significant downturn from Q4 2018's 12% top-line expansion, which blew away estimates on the back of strong box office performances. At the bottom end of the income statement, DIS' adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to plummet 16.9% to $1.57 a share. Last quarter, the company's adjusted EPS figure soared 38% and crushed our Zacks Consensus Estimate. On top of these projected top and bottom-line declines, investors need to know how Disney's individual business units are expected to perform. Luckily, we can turn our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file for help. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.     Media Networks  Disney's Media Networks unit is the company's largest segment and is comprised of its cable and broadcast division, which includes ESPN. This unit is projected to see its revenues climb roughly 0.7% from the year-ago period to reach $6.288 billion. This vital division's revenues popped 9% to $5.963 billion last quarter. More specifically, Disney's cable unit is expected to climb about 0.5% to $4.518 billion. Meanwhile, the broadcast division is projected to pop just over 1% to reach $1.770 billion. Both of these estimates mark slowdowns from Q4's 5% and 21% respective expansions.  Parks and Resorts  Moving on, Disney's Park and Resorts revenues are projected to climb 8.5% to reach $5.591 billion. Last quarter, the theme park unit also popped 9%, but fell short of our NFM estimate.  Studio Entertainment  Lastly, let's look at the company's most volatile unit, Studio Entertainment. The division is prone to major quarterly swings and big surprise, in either direction, based on the nature of movie release schedules and box office hits. With that said, Studio Entertainment revenue is projected to sink roughly 15% from the year-ago quarter to $2.115 billion. As we touched on at the top, the division's revenues skyrocketed 50% last quarter.  Bottom Line  Shares of Disney closed regular trading Friday down marginally to $111.30 a share, which marked a 7.5% downturn from its 52-week high of $120.20. Disney is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) that sports a ""B"" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. Disney is currently scheduled to release its first-quarter 2019 financial results after the closing bell on Tuesday, February 5.

Net sales grew 19.7% to $72.4 billion and   earnings per share increased 61% to $6.04. Analysts were   expecting earnings of $5.67 on sales of $71.9 billion. North American sales grew 18%, international sales were up a   strong 19% excluding currency, and the company's highly   profitable Amazon Web Services grew revenue by 45% to $7.4   billion. Sales in the ""Other"" category, which is mainly   advertising, grew a whopping 97% excluding currency, to $3.4   billion. Operating income in the quarter soared 78% year over   year and free cash flow for the full year grew 134%. Amazon forecast first-quarter sales between $56 billion and   $60 billion, which was less than the analyst consensus of $61   billion and may have gotten investors worried about   slowing sales growth    despite   soaring profits    . The company also said in the   conference call    that it expects to increase investments in operational   efficiencies relative to what it spent in 2018. ExxonMobil grows profits on rising production ExxonMobile handily beat Wall Street expectations for   profit in the fourth quarter despite a drop in    oil   prices    , and shares rose 3.6%. The company earned $1.41 per share, which   was down from $1.97 in the period a year ago but well above the   $1.08 analysts were expecting. Excluding the effect of tax reform and asset impairments,   earnings actually rose 72% to $6.4 billion. Lower prices for   crude were offset by   higher production volumes    , especially in the Permian Basin, where production was up 12%   from last quarter and 93% from Q4 2017. Exxon also benefited from   higher gas prices and improved efficiencies in its refining   operations due to integration of logistics and manufacturing. Revenue of $71.9 billion was an 8.1% increase over last   year, but missed the analyst estimate of $78.4 billion.

138,"February 01, 2019, 04:11:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,What to Expect from Google Parent Alphabet's (GOOGL) Q4 Earnings,"
 Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL  , like fellow tech giants and much of the market, have surged since Christmas. With that said,  Google stock  has effectively moved sideways over the last year. So, let's see what to expect from the firm's fourth-quarter financial results that are due out after the closing bell Monday.  Quick Overview  Google has been an internet powerhouse for years and its search engine and web browsers are nearly ubiquitous today.  Google report  edly grabbed over 37% of total US digital ad spending in 2018, which crushed second-place Facebook's FB  roughly 21% and third-place Amazon's AMZN  4.1%. The company's ability to attract advertisers will likely grow as Netflix NFLX  and other non-ad supported platforms continue to expand. On top of that, Alphabet competes against the likes of Apple AAPL  and other hardware markers with its Pixel smartphones, Home smart speaker, and more. The firm also boasts a cloud computing business, an app store, and has bet on the future with divisions such as its self-driving car segment Waymo.         Q4 Outlook    Moving on, current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Google's fourth-quarter revenues to surge 20.90% to reach $31.28 billion. Investors should note that our revenue estimate excludes total traffic acquisition cost or TAC (TAC is the portion of revenues shared with Google's partners and amounts paid to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to the Google website). The company's non-TAC revenues jumped 21.9% to hit $27.16 billion in the third quarter, while Google's total traffic acquisition costs hit $6.582 billion. At the bottom end of the income statement, Alphabet has seen its Q4 earnings estimate revision picture turn more negative over the last 30 days. With that said, the company's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to climb 14.23% to hit $11.08 per share. Last quarter, the firm's adjusted EPS figure soared 36.5% year over year. More specifically, Google's core advertising business is projected to jump roughly 18.7% from $27.227 billion in the year-ago period to reach $32.335 billion, based on our current NFM estimates. Meanwhile, Google's TAC is expected to reach $7.559 billion.         Bottom Line  Alphabet is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on its recen t earnings  estimate revision activity. GOOGL also sports an ""A"" grade for Growth but a ""D"" for both Value and Momentum in our Style Scores system. As we mentioned at the top, shares of GOOGL are nearly flat over the last 12 months. Google stock rested at around $1,121 a share Friday, which marked a roughly 13% downturn from its 52-week high of $1,291 per share. Alphabet is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results after the closing bell on Monday, February 4.

 What happened Shares of   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) were down 5.3% as of 3 p.m. EST Friday after the   e-commerce giant announced   strong fourth-quarter 2018 results    , but followed with lighter-than-expected forward guidance. More specifically on the former, Amazon's quarterly net sales   soared 20% year over year (21% at constant currency) to $72.4   billion, and operating income jumped 78% to $3.8 billion. Both   metrics arrived near the high ends of Amazon's guidance provided   in October, which   called for    revenue between $66.5 billion and $72.5 billion, and operating   income of $2.1 billion to $3.6 billion. On the bottom line,   Amazon's net income climbed to $3 billion, or $6.04 per share, up   from adjusted earnings of $2.16 per share in the same year-ago   period and well above the $5.67 most investors were   anticipating.   IMAGE SOURCE: AMAZON.COM.makeArticleAd();  So what Amazon's top-line growth was broad-based, with North American   sales climbing 18.3% to $44.1 billion, international revenue   rising 15.5% to $20.8 billion, and sales from the high-margin   Amazon Web Services business jumping 45.3% to $7.4 billion. Amazon's founder and CEO Jeff Bezos noted that the company's   Alexa-based products fared particularly well during the holidays,   with Echo Dot standing tall as the ""best-selling item across all   products on Amazon globally."" Bezos elaborated:  In 2018, we improved Alexa's ability to understand requests     and answer questions by more than 20% through advances in     machine learning, we added billions of facts making Alexa more     knowledgeable than ever, developers doubled the number of Alexa     skills to over 80,000, and customers spoke to Alexa tens of     billions more times in 2018 compared to 2017. We're energized     by and grateful for the response, and you can count on us to     keep working hard to bring even more invention to     customers.  For the first quarter of 2019, however, Amazon expects net   sales between $56 billion and $60 billion (up between 10% and 18%   year over year), and operating income of between $2.3 billion and   $3.3 billion (up from $1.9 billion in the same year-ago period).   By comparison, most analysts watching the stock were looking for   revenue growth closer to 19%. Now what To be fair, during the   subsequent conference call    , management offered the caveat that Amazon's ""results are   inherently unpredictable"" and can vary greatly based on global   economic conditions, world events, foreign-exchange rates, and   growth rates for the broader e-commerce industry and cloud   services markets. If anything, in recent years, the company has   shown a propensity for underpromising and overdelivering. Given the uncertainty surrounding the gravity of Amazon's   decelerating growth as it builds on an increasingly mammoth base,   however -- and with shares up more than 20% in the year leading   up to this report -- it's no surprise to see Amazon stock down   modestly in response today.

By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - A U.S. agency that insures worker pensions sought permission on Friday to take over two underfunded Sears Holdings Corp  pension plans, after objecting to Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert's proposed $5.2 billion buyout of the bankrupt retailer.
In a complaint filed in Chicago federal court, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp asked to be named trustee of the pension plans, which it said are underfunded by $1.4 billion and cover about 90,000 Sears and Kmart employees and retirees.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Friday's request came six days after the PBGC objected to the takeover of Sears by Lampert's hedge fund ESL Investments, which had won an auction for the Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer last month. 
In a filing with the White Plains, New York court overseeing Sears' Chapter 11 case, the PBGC said Lampert's proposal would strip its rights in trademarks and licensing royalties from the DieHard and Kenmore brands.
That would ""intentionally undermine PBGC's statutory and contractual pension plan protections,"" the agency said.
A spokesman for Sears declined to comment.
In a bankruptcy court filing on Friday, ESL said the PBGC ""misread"" the buyout terms and its objection should be rejected.
Created in 1974, the PBGC uses employer insurance premiums, investment earnings and other funds to pay retiree benefits.
Sears, founded 126 years ago, filed for bankruptcy in October after a prolonged decline marked by too much debt, scant investment and lost market share to retailers such as Walmart Inc, Home Depot Inc  and Amazon.com Inc.
The proposed ESL takeover calls for 425 Sears and Kmart stores to remain open and 45,000 workers to keep their jobs, but has drawn objections from a committee of unsecured creditors.
ESL on Friday urged U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain to reject those objections.
""The question before the court is whether the debtors exercised sound business judgment in approving the proposed sale,"" ESL said, referring to bankrupt Sears entities. ""The record abundantly demonstrates that they did.""
The next hearing is set for Monday morning.
The PBGC case is Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp v Sears Holdings Corp, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 19-00669. The bankruptcy case is In re: Sears Holdings Corp et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-23538.

163,"February 01, 2019, 09:28:59 AM EDT",AMZN,InvestorPlace Media,Amazon’s Earnings Report Is Not a Reason to Sell AMZN Stock,"
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) reported earnings last night and traders are selling Amazon stock on the headline. The knee-jerk reaction in after-hours action had investors buying it up 3% on top of the day when it had already rallied 2.9%. The rally didn't last as Amazon stock flipped red, diving down 5%. Overall, I consider it a washout range for the day: up 6%, down 5%.makeArticleAd();This is not to say that management delivered a bad quarter. In fact, they grew their sales 20% over last year. Although this is slower than past reports, it still is impressive for a company that is close to $1 trillion in market cap.My point today will be that anytime is a good time to go long AMZN, even on red days like this. If your horizon is longer than a few days, then in the long term if equity markets are higher, AMZN stock is leading the pack up.There wasn't much bad news in the performance metrics. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was up 46%, contributing $7.4 billion in sales. This is impressive, especially when you consider that it comes from an already dominant position. Furthermore, they reported 95% growth in advertising which is their newest hot area. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) should worry - the beast is coming.So from a ""report card"" perspective, Jeff Bezos and his team delivered another strong quarter.Why Are Amazon Stock Owners Disappointed?So where did the disappointment come from? Guidance. AMZN lowered their sales forecast. They now see $56 to $60 billion of net first-quarter sales down from the expectations of $60.99.10 High-Yield Monthly Dividend StocksBut this is not a systemic problem from faulty execution. India decided to enforce a new law that will severely impact e-commerce there. AMZN and Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) are the two biggest U.S.-based victims of this law. So there will be an adjustment period until they figure things out. And that explains their caution in lowering Wall Street's expectation in the coming quarters.Management is right to temper trader exuberance. This is a stock that has been running 100 miles an hour for over a decade. More to the point, it is up over 30% Since Christmas from low to high. Buyers need a rest and that will end up being another opportunity to go long AMZN stock.This is the mother of all momentum stocks. It will rarely give us a perfect entry point. On the way up it moves so fast that it would scare most investors into staying out. Now, as it is falling, most traders will avoid AMZN stock until they digest this Indian law news and its real impact on sales.AMZN was not built on Indian income. This is merely one of its opportunity areas. So to think that one region is going to cripple this beast of a company is naive. By looking at a long-term monthly chart, you can clearly see that waiting a few days out before buying AMZN stock is not crucial. Over time, it will be higher.If the stock markets rally, then Amazon stock will be leading the charge. So this dip on the headline is not alarming.If you own the stock, this is not a reason to sell it. If I am thinking of buying it, this headline should not sway me from taking a starter position. Can I wait out a few more ticks to be cautious? Sure. Like I already said, a few ticks up or down are not going to matter in the long run. AMZN is a beast of a stock and the company still has so much going for it.Consider the potential income that will come to AMZN from the licensing of Alexa technologies. I bet that every appliance in our daily lives will have a voice command option. AMZN has the one that is ready for deployment. This would be income that will flow big to the bottom line. There is not much incremental cost in licensing the tech. Usually, most costs fall on the licensee's shoulders.Bottom Line on AMZN StockThis dip could get a little bigger because Amazon stock just came out of a 36% correction from the September highs to the December lows. So the memories of the lost market cap are still fresh in investors' minds.7 S&P 500 Stocks to Buy That Tore Up EarningsBut it is important to remember that the reason for the fall was due to extremely sour sentiment on Wall Street system-wide. Tariff wars and a combatant Federal Reserve are extraneous factors that caused investors to sell everything. AMZN stock being the mo-mo stock that it is sold faster than most.This is a company that knows how to figure things out and without fanfare.  Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM ) set the trend years ago for what we now call ""the cloud."" AMZN proliferated it and now own it. AWS is the Goliath and even companies as big as  Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) are trying to catch up.Since everything now either runs on the cloud or is slated for migration to it, there will be enough business for most of the major competitors to thrive for years to come. This tizzy too shall pass.Click  here  for a bonus video that I recently shared discussing Square (SQ).

Fueled by a bullish labor marke t report  , stock futures on Wall Street lunged higher Friday and trimmed earlier gains to set Dow and S&P futures back in the green leading into Friday's open. The Nasdaq remains negative, weighed down by Amazon ( AMZN  ). The US economy created 304,000 new jobs in January, almost twice what Wall Street expected. Although December's blowout number was revised down to 222,000 from 312,000, there was plenty of good news in the report to dispel fears of an impending recession. Private payrolls were up 296,000 and the participation rate improved to 63.2 from 63.1. Additionally, average hourly earnings increased just 0.1%, cooling inflationary jitters among investors. Heading into the data, stock futures were trading lower as underwhelming progress towards a US-China trade deal coupled with disappointing guidance from Amazon weighed on sentiment. Following the lead of European bourses on the heels of downbeat Chinese and European manufacturing data, the major market indices were all indicated to open lower with the Nasdaq lagging until the jobs report gave Wall Street a shot in the arm.makeArticleAd(); After the close Thursday,  Amazon report  ed better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter, but issued Q1 guidance that was shy of Wall Street's expectations. Additionally, the company's CFO alerted investors as to the regulatory roadblocks in India as well as the burden of increased investments. Friday's remaining data includes the January ISM manufacturing index, the final January University of Michigan consumer sentiment index, and November wholesale inventories. After the opening bell, Dallas Fed president Rob Kaplan will participate in a Q&A in Austin. -Dow Jones Industrial up 0.24% -S&P 500 futures up 0.04% -Nasdaq 100 futures down 0.43% SENTIMENT Nikkei up 0.07% Hang Seng down 0.04% Shanghai Composite up 1.30% FTSE-100 up 0.54% DAX-30 up 0.03% PRE-MARKET SECTOR WATCH (-) Large cap tech: Lower (-) Chip stocks: Lower (-) Software stocks: Lower (-) Hardware stocks: Lower (-) Internet stocks: Lower (+/-) Oil stocks: Mixed (-) Biotech stocks: Lower (+) Drug stocks: Higher (-) Financial stocks: Lower (+/-) Retail stocks: Mixed (-) Industrial stocks: Lower (+/-) Airlines: Flat (-) Autos: Lower UPSIDE MOVERS: (+) TTNP (+82.93%) Reported double-digit increase in total product shipments of Probuphine (+) CUO (+34.14%) Sold Transit Mix Concrete for $27 million (+) FLWS (+9.66%) Extending gains from Q2 earnings beat, PT raised at DA Davidson DOWNSIDE MOVERS: (-) VEDL (-16.83%) Purchased $200 million stake in Anglo American (-) MLSS (-16.28%) Announced stock and warrant offering (-) OPK (-2.72%) Suspended mid-stage trial for enlarged prostate treatment

  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL -February 1, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Disney DIS  , Amazon AMZN  , World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. WWE  and Take-Two Interactive TTWO  .  Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst   Blog:    Disney to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?    Disney  is slated to report first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Feb 5. The company's earnings beat the Zack Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering average positive surprise of 8.5%. In fourth-quarter 2018, adjusted earnings increased 38% from the year-ago quarter to $1.48 per share. Revenues increased 12% from the year-ago quarter to $14.31 billion. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings has declined from $1.59 to $1.57 over the past seven days, indicating year-over-year decline of 16.9%. Moreover, the consensus mark for revenues, which is pegged at $15.18 billion, is down 1.1% year over year. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.  Demand-Based Pricing to Aid Parks & Resorts   Revenues  Disney's innovative strategies in managing its Parks & Resorts are expected to aid the segments revenues in first-quarter fiscal 2019. To better manage customer attendance, the company extended its demand-based pricing strategy to multi-day tickets in the soon-to-be reported quarter. The initiative will not only distribute demand throughout the year to avoid any fluctuations in revenues but may also help Disney provide better services by reducing wait time. Additionally, these changes are expected to enrich user experience thereby aiding attendance growth and per capita spending. Notably, these were the two main contributors to Parks & Resorts (35.4% of revenues) segment revenue growth of 8.6% year over year to $5.1 billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.  Box Office Success to Drive Studio Entertainment   Growth  This apart, Disney's Studio Entertainment segment may get a boost with the box office success of Ralph Breaks the Internet  and Mary Poppins Returns  . Notably, Ralph Breaks the Internet  , with an estimated production cost of $175 million collected about $211 million globally after the first five days of its release. Moreover, robust collections from these movies are expected to boost demand for merchandise. This bodes well for the Consumer Products division.  Streaming Losses May Hurt Results  Although Disney's sports streaming service ESPN+ is gaining increasing traction among users on the back of a strong content lineup and targeted demographic advantage, significant competition from Amazon is a headwind. Amazon Prime also offers an array of exclusive content including major sports content. Moreover, increasing investments in its streaming platforms are expected to hurt first-quarter fiscal 2019 margins. Notably, management guided that investments in ESPN+ will have a negative impact of $100 million on operating income in first-quarter fiscal 2019. Moreover, Disney lost more than $1 billion from its streaming segments in 2018, of which Hulu's loss of about $580 million was the major factor. Notably, Hulu is jointly owned by Disney (30%), Fox (30%), Comcast (30%) and AT & T (10%).  What Our Model Says  According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP  has a good chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. Disney has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

169,"February 01, 2019, 08:25:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,5 Top Stocks to Own This February,"
 It has been almost 30 years, since Wall Street has performed this well in January.  Both the S&P 500 and Dow advanced more than 7% last month, registering their biggest gains since January 1987 and January 1989, respectively. This is indeed an amazing recovery considering the fact that December was one of the worst months for stocks in almost 90 years. Upbeat corporate earnings, undoubtedly, helped stocks move north so far this year. The Dow, in particular, has been aided by nearly 20% increases in The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS  , International Business Machines Corporation IBM  and The Boeing Company BA  . All these blue chips posted encouraging fourth-quarter results and provided healthy outlooks. Tech stocks also moved up, primarily on account of solid earnings results. Needless to say, FAANG stocks like Facebook, Inc. FB  and Netflix, Inc. NFLX  each surged nearly 30% last month on the back of robus t earnings  , helping the Nasdaq gain 10% since the beginning of the year. The tech-laden index, in fact, had its best January since 2001. Some of the other major players that topped forecasts included Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN  and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL  , whose shares shot up more than 8% on a year-to-date basis. Even Apple Inc. AAPL  , which began the year with discouraging sales guidance sending its stocks plummeting, is now up 6% for the year following its better-than-anticipated results. While positive earnings season should certainly provide momentum to stocks heading into February, investors were also spurred by a trio of positive news related to government shutdown, trade war and the Fed policy.  Trio of Positive News  On the political side, senators from both sides of the aisle agreed to introduce an amendment that will temporarily reopen part of the government. While it may be too early to predict when the shutdown will end completely, at least it seems lawmakers are in mood to resolve the issue. Such a positive development, no doubt, encouraged Wall Street. After all, several companies have been raising their concerns about the Washington gridlock affecting their revenues and costing them money. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently confirmed that the United States and China have made significant progress on talks to end the ongoing trade related dispute that sparked apprehensions of global economic slowdown. Trade war could have also easily overshadowed the benefits of the large tax cuts and deregulatory efforts taken by the Trump administration. The Fed's latest comment that the rate increases are on a pause is of utmost significance. This dovish stance will certainly help the broader market chug along in the near term. At the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting this week, the Fed confirmed that it would be ""patient"" with future rate hikes and has also indicated that the unwind of the asset portfolio could conclude sooner than expected. Such views were widely considered as accommodative measures, at least for the time being, and have had a soothing effect on investors. After all, the Fed increasing rates last year did took a toll on them. And why not? Hike in rates increases the cost of lending money from financial institutions for small and medium business houses. This in turn could exert more pressure on the U.S. economy that is on the cusp of a slowdown this year.  5 Best Stocks to Buy in February  Courtesy of a dovish Fed, temporary end to government shutdown, optimism that U.S.-China trade deal might be on the cards and promising start to the earnings season, we are lined up for a strong February rally. Just a word of caution! China's factory activity, currently, is shrinking and that may stifle the rally. Consequently, it will be prudent to invest in five of the best stocks that can make the most of the largely bullish trend, and at the same time has limited exposure to the Chinese market. These stocks, by the by, have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score  of A. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.  Office Depot, Inc. ODP  offer office supplies in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has moved up 3% in the past 60 days. The company's expected earnings growth rate for the next quarter is 50%, in contrast with the industry's projected decline of 20.3%.  Rent-A-Center, Inc  . RCII  leases household durable goods to customers on a rent-to-own basis. The company own stores in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has moved up 10.8% in the past 60 days.

175,"February 01, 2019, 08:02:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,"Amazon's Earnings Were Strong, but Its Outlook Disappointed: 5 Metrics You Should See","
  Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 results   after the market close on Thursday. As it did in the first three quarters of the year,   the e-commerce and cloud computing giant once again beat   Wall Street's earnings expectation. It also slightly exceeded the   Street's revenue consensus estimate. Shares declined 4.9% in after-hours trading on Thursday. We   can attribute the market's reaction to first-quarter 2019 revenue   guidance coming in lighter than Wall Street was expecting, along   with concerns about the company's plans -- shared on the       earnings call    -- to increase spending on investments in 2019 relative to   2018.makeArticleAd(); Here's an overview of Amazon's quarter, along with its   guidance for the first quarter of 2019, using five metrics.   Image source: Amazon.com.  1. Revenue jumped 20% Amazon's net quarterly sales increased 20% year over year to   $72.38 billion, exceeding the $71.87 billion Wall Street   consensus estimate and coming in at the high end of the company's   guidance range of $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion. Excluding the   $801 million loss from foreign exchange, revenue grew 21%. Revenue growth slowed considerably this quarter after   beginning to slow last quarter, when it increased 29% year over   year. This is largely because this quarter Amazon fully lost its   revenue bump from its Whole Foods acquisition, as it bought the   organic grocer in the third quarter of 2017. Here's how segment growth broke out:      Segment     Revenue Q4 2018     Change (YOY)          North America   $44.12 billion   18%     International   $20.83 billion   15%     Amazon Web Services (AWS)   $7.43 billion   45%     Total   $72.38 billion   20%     Data source: Amazon. YOY=year over year. AWS's revenue continued to grow at a breakneck pace. Its   revenue growth isn't accelerating anymore, as it was for several   quarters through to Q2 2018, but it's also not decelerating, as   it did last quarter. In constant currency, the cloud computing   service's revenue has increased year over year as follows: 46% in   Q4 2018, 46% in   Q3 2018    , 49% in   Q2 2018    , 48% in Q1 2018, 44% in Q4 2017, and 42% in Q3 2017. Breaking out revenue another way:  Online retail sales grew 13% year over year as reported,     and 14% in constant currency, to $39.82 billion. Physical-store sales declined 3% on both a reported and     constant currency basis to $4.40 billion. Third-party seller commission and fulfillment fees rose 27%     as reported, and 28% in constant currency, to $13.38     billion. Subscription services (Prime and other) jumped 25% as     reported, and 26% in constant currency, to $3.96 billion.     Year-over-year growth slowed considerably from the previous     three quarters because in 2018 the company changed the way it     accounted for subscription revenue. This change resulted in     some revenue that in the past would be booked in Q4 being     pushed into the prior three quarters. AWS sales surged 45% as reported, and 46% in constant     currency, to $7.43 billion. Other sales, which include advertising revenue, rocketed     95% as reported, and 97% in constant currency, to $3.39     billion.  2. Operating income soared 78% Operating income increased 78% year over year to $3.79   billion, comfortably exceeding Amazon's guidance of $2.1 billion   to $3.6 billion. As has been the story all year, increased   efficiencies in North America and AWS drove the growth in   operating income.      Segment     Operating Income Q4 2018     Change (YOY)          North America   $2.25 billion   33%     International   ($642 million)  Loss narrowed by 30.1%    AWS   $2.18 billion  60.8%    Total   $3.79 billion   17.6%     Data source: Amazon. YOY=year over year. The quarter's big story had to be AWS' scorching 61%   year-over-year growth in operating income, followed by the North   America segment's quite solid growth in operating income, driven   by a strong holiday quarter. AWS continues to get more profitable on a year-over-year   basis. Its operating margin (operating income divided by revenue)   was 29.3% in the quarter, up from 26.5% in the year-ago period,   though down slightly from 31.1% in the third quarter. 3. Adjusted EPS rocketed 180% Net income increased 63% to $3.03 billion. On a per-share   basis, earnings per share (EPS) leaped 61% to $6.04, up from   $3.75 in the year-ago period. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a provisional tax benefit   of approximately $789 million associated with U.S. tax reform.   Excluding this benefit, EPS nearly tripled, up from $2.16 in the   year-ago quarter. Adjusted EPS comfortably beat the $5.67 that   Wall Street was looking for. 4. Operating cash flow surged 67% over the trailing-12-month   period Operating cash flow rose 67% year over year to $30.7 billion   for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow more than doubled to   $19.4 billion, from $8.3 billion. 5. Revenue growth of 10% to 18% is expected in Q1   2019 For the first quarter of 2019, Amazon guided for net sales of   $56 billion to $60 billion, representing growth of 10% to 18%   year over year. The high end of this range falls a little short   of the $60.96 billion Wall Street was projecting, which was   probably the main reason for the market sending shares of Amazon   down in after-hours trading on Thursday evening. The company expects operating income of $2.3 billion to $3.3   billion, representing growth of 21% to 74% year over year. The bottom line In short, Amazon turned in a strong quarter. Its first-quarter 2019 revenue and operating income outlook   ranges are both quite wide. There's a huge difference between   year-over-year revenue growth of 10% with operating growth of 18%   (the low end of both ranges) and year-over-year revenue growth of   18% with operating income growth of 74%. Given that Amazon tends   to issue conservative guidance, it seems more likely than not   that investors can probably expect the first quarter of 2019 to   be at least quite solid, perhaps even robust.

  Illustration by Michael   Haddad   6:48 a.m.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average  appears set for a flat open. The same can't be said for the Nasdaq Composite. Dow futures have ticked up 26 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500  futures have dipped 0.1%, and Nasdaq futures have dropped 0.5%. The Nasdaq is getting hit by Amazon.com  (AMZN), which has dropped 4.6% to $1,640 after reporting earnings. The earnings weren't so bad. In fact Amazon's profit and sales easily topped expectations. Its guidance, however, fell short of predictions.makeArticleAd(); Amazon's impact on the S&P 500 is smaller, it is nonexistent for the Dow, which doesn't contain the e-commerce titan. Their direction could be determined by January's payrolls report, due this morning at 8:30. A solid report-a 180,000 increase in new jobs is expected-would indicate that the U.S. economy is still going strong. Too big an increase, though, and the Fed's pause on interest rate hikes could be shorter than the market thinks. A big disappointment could rekindle recession fears. And that will ultimately be more important than any one earnings report, even Amazon's.  Write to  Ben Levisohn at  Ben.Levisohn@barrons.com

181,"February 01, 2019, 06:02:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,5 Top Stocks to Buy in February,"
 January has been a strong month for the stock market, with   most major indices rebounding sharply from their late 2018 slump.   However, there are still some compelling bargains to be   found. Here's why five of our contributors think   Synchrony Financial    (NYSE: SYF) ,   Hess    (NYSE: HES) ,   IBM    (NYSE: IBM) ,   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) , and   Booking Holdings    (NASDAQ: BKNG) are some of the best stocks to buy in   February.   Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  Two   big    wins for this highly profitable bank   Matt Frankel, CFP    (Synchrony Financial):    Synchrony Financial is a leader in both store credit cards and   high-yield online savings accounts, and its business is firing on   all cylinders. Loan balances grew by 14% over the past year, and   the bank's efficiency and 16% net interest margin would make most   financial institutions jealous. In addition, Synchrony investors just got answers to two big   lingering questions stemming from the loss of   Walmart    as a co-branding partner in mid-2018. First, it was just revealed that Sam's Club will continue to   be a Synchrony partner. That makes the loss of Walmart a bit more   palatable, as it's certainly easier to replace lost revenue from   one major partner instead of two. Second, and perhaps more   significantly, Walmart agreed to drop the $800 million lawsuit it   had filed against Synchrony, which was alleging mismanagement of   the co-branded credit card product. As a result of these two developments, and because it's   selling its Walmart loan portfolio to   Capital One    , Synchrony is releasing about $500 million in loss reserves,   which can now be used to help grow the business. The best part is that even after the post-news pop, Synchrony   trades for just 6.8 times forward earnings, so this highly   profitable financial institution is still a compelling   bargain. An oil company worth owning   Todd Campbell  (Hess ):    Oil prices nosedived in the final months of 2018, thanks to   greater supply that resulted from allowing countries to import   crude from Iran, and oil stocks crashed as a result. There's no   telling where    oil   prices    are heading from here, but some of these energy stocks are   offering investors an intriguing opportunity to buy, including   Hess. This company is a few years into a   major restructuring    that's included ditching mature, slow-growing fields in places   like the North Sea, spinning off infrastructure assets, paying   down debt, cutting costs, and ramping up production in the Bakken   Shale. A decision to increase the number of rigs operating in the   profit-friendly Bakken helped production there to increase to an   average 118,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in Q3   from 103,000 in the same quarter in 2017. Hess thinks Bakken   production will exceed 135,000 boepd in 2019 and that it could   reach 200,000 by 2021. If that happens, it would translate into   $1 billion in free cash flow annually for the company beyond   2020, at $60-per-barrel West Texas Intermediate prices. An even bigger opportunity for Hess may exist offshore from   Guyana, where it owns 30% of the Stabroek block, a massive field   with   5 billion discovered barrels    of oil equivalent that should enter production in 2020.   Production there and in the Bakken has Hess thinking it can grow   production by over 10% compounded annually through 2025. The increasing production and cost controls that are expected   to lower Hess' breakeven point to $40 per barrel (Brent) has the   company forecasting compounded annual cash flow growth of 20%   through 2025. Overall, Hess has a shot at seeing its financials improve   significantly over the next few years, and given that its shares   have tumbled 28% from its peak last October, I'm thinking now's a   great time to pick up some shares. A tech turnaround story   Tim Green  (IBM):    Shares of IBM surged after the century-old tech company reported   its fourth-quarter results in January. IBM is still dealing with   slumping revenue as it invests in cloud computing, artificial   intelligence, blockchain, and other growth areas. But the stock   was and still is priced for disaster, and the company's 2019   guidance shows that IBM is more resilient than the market seems   to believe. IBM expects to produce at least $13.90 in adjusted earnings   per share in 2019, up from $13.81 in 2018, and around $12 billion   of free cash flow. That guidance excludes the impact of   the   Red Hat    acquisition    , since the timing of the $34 billion deal set to close in the   second half will have a meaningful impact on the company's   results. IBM is able to grow earnings and produce solid free cash   flow because of its key competitive advantages, including   decades-long customer relationships, a broad portfolio of   products and services, and a deeply embedded position in certain   industries. Shares of IBM trade for less than 10 times the company's   earnings guidance, a multiple that bakes in a level of pessimism   that just doesn't make any sense. The stock also sports a   dividend yield of about 4.7%, and the company plans to keep   growing the dividend after it closes on the Red Hat deal. IBM has been a frustrating stock to own over the past few   years. But the foundation is in place for the company to exit   this era of revenue declines and return to sustainable growth. At   less than 10 times earnings, the stock is a steal.  Amazon's ever-expanding opportunities    Chris Neiger    (Amazon.com):    Amazon's soaring share price over the past few years has probably   kept some investors away from this stellar company. But now that   the share price has dropped about 8% over the past three months,   a fantastic buying opportunity has opened up for those who've   been waiting on the sidelines. Not only are the company's shares trading at somewhat of a   discount to the stock's high four months ago, but Amazon's core   businesses also continue to fire on all cylinders, and its   expansion into new markets, including advertising, could bring   the company even more sales growth. Amazon's business has benefited from its dominance in the   e-commerce market. Nearly 49% of all online sales in the U.S. are   made on the company's platform, and its online dominance   continues to grow. Consider that Amazon now has   more than 100 million Prime members    , and it's estimated that   more than half of all U.S. households    will have a Prime membership by the end of this year. The   significance of Amazon's Prime memberships is best understood   when you know that these members spend, on average,   about $800 more    on the company's platform each year than non-Prime members   do. But Amazon's opportunities are expanding beyond e-commerce, of   course. Amazon has wisely found a new way to turn its retail   prowess into an entirely new business by benefiting from ad sales   on its platform. Last year, Amazon became the   third largest U.S. digital advertising   platform    in the U.S., with 4% of the market. Amazon's share is expected to   reach 7% by the end of 2020, and about three years from now the   company's advertising sales have the potential to top $22   billion, up from just $4 billion in 2017. Amazon's booming advertising business shows just how well the   company can take one success -- a dominant e-commerce platform --   and turn it into another big win. The company has proved over and   over again that it can't be boxed into traditional markets, and   with Amazon's shares now cheaper than they've been in months, it   might be the right time to invest in this massive disrupter. A proven winner at a value price   Brian Feroldi    (Booking Holdings):    The name ""Booking Holdings"" might not ring a bell, but   the odds are good that you know   this company's brands. This online travel giant owns a   number of leading properties that include Priceline.com,   RentalCars.com, Kayak.com, Agoda.com, OpenTable, Booking.com, and   more. Booking Holdings has been a   huge    beneficiary of the gradual shift away from travel agents over the   past couple of decades. The company's brands have become a   trusted resource for millions of travelers from around the   world who want to book a great vacation for an affordable price.   That has driven outsize revenue and profit growth for many years.   Better yet, the increased scale has allowed the company's   margins to steadily increase    , and long-term shareholders have been hugely rewarded. The   stock is up 2,450% since 2009. The company's massive success has allowed it to grow into   an $80 billion giant. However, even with its gargantuan   size, Booking's sales and earnings are still growing at a brisk   pace. Last quarter these numbers were   14% and 19%    , respectively. Better yet, the company's strong growth rates   should persist for years to come, since the online travel market   is still growing and represents only   a fraction     of the total travel spending. Wall Street believes Booking Holdings' profits will grow by   more than 15% annually over the next five years. That's a blazing   fast number for a business currently trading for less than 17   times forward earnings. That's why I'd be a happy buyer of   Booking's stock today if it wasn't already one of my   largest personal holdings    .   10 stocks we like better than IBM       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

  Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. CHKP  reported solid fourth-quarter 2018 results wherein both the top line and bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  makeArticleAd();  The company's non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.68 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.63. The figure came above the company's guidance of $1.56-$1.67 and climbed 6% year over year, driven mainly by higher revenues and lower share count.    Revenues came in at $526 million, up 4% year over year. The figure was within the company's guidance of $500-$528 million, and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $517 million.

Price, Consensus     and EPS Surprise        Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Price,   Consensus and EPS Surprise    |      Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. Quote    Quarter Details    Security subscription revenues were $146.6 million, increasing 12.8% year over year, driven by strong demand for cloud, mobile and zero-day advanced threat prevention technologies.    However, revenues of $160.6 million from Products and licenses fell 3.1% year over year.    Software updates and maintenance revenues increased to $218.3 million, representing 3.8% growth.    As of Dec 31, 2018, deferred revenues were $1.34 billion, up 13% year over year, reflecting strength in security subscription and support.    Geographically, the Americas generated 45% of total revenues, Europe accounted for 39% while the Asia Pacific, Japan and the Middle East and Africa accounted for the remaining 16%.    Talking about deal size, the number of new customers - who signed deals worth $1 million or more - totaled 102. The value of these transactions increased significantly in the fourth quarter. In the quarter, Check Point bagged Infinity deals in various industries.    Check Point also acquired Dome9, with which it expects to enhance its Infinity architecture and CloudGuard security offering.    Moreover, Check Point hit a few milestones this quarter, including CloudGuard's integration with Amazon's AMZN  AWS Security Hub. This further strengthened the CloudGuard portfolio.     Operating Results    Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter came in at $279 million, falling 4.5% year over year. Non-GAAP operating margin contracted 470 basis points (bps) to 53%. This can be attributed to increased investments in sales and marketing efforts by the company.    Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $264 million, up from $259 million in the year-earlier quarter.    For full-year 2018, non-GAAP operating income came in at $1.015 billion, falling 0.9% year over year. Non-GAAP operating margin contracted 200 bps to 53%. Non-GAAP net income was $911 million, up from $888 million in the previous year.   Balance Sheet & Other Financial Details    Check Point exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term deposits of $1.75 billion compared with $4.07 billion in the previous quarter, due to the buyout.    During the reported quarter, the company generated cash worth $249 million from operational activities, remaining flat sequentially.    The company repurchased approximately 2.8 million shares for about $305 million in the fourth quarter and approximately 10.3 million shares for about $1.1 billion in the full year.   Outlook    Check Point provided guidance for the full year of 2019. Revenues are expected to be in the range $1.94-$2.04 billion. Non-GAAP EPS is projected to be within $5.85-$6.25.    Revenues for the full year of 2019 are expected to be between $1.940 billion, up to $2.040 billion. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year is expected to be between $5.85 and $6.25.

Feb 1 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures inched lower on Friday, as subdued factory data from China and disappointing outlook from Amazon stalled optimism after the S&P 500 posted its best month since 2015.
Amazon.com Inc  fell 4.2 percent in premarket trading after the e-commerce giant forecast quarterly sales below Wall Street estimates, overshadowing its record sales and profit during the holiday season. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Factory activity was at its weakest in years across much of the world during January, adding to worries trade tariffs, political uncertainty and cooling demand posed an increasing threat to global growth. 
Trade-focused Asia appeared to be suffering the most visible loss of momentum, with Caixin/Markit index of Chinese manufacturing falling to its lowest since February 2016.
Investors are hoping that a trade deal between the United States and China, engaged in a bitter tariff war, could ease some of the slowdown concerns.
January ended on a high-note for U.S. markets after the Federal Reserve pledged that it would be patient in raising interest rates further this year and U.S. President Donald Trump said he would meet Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal. 
Markets are looking ahead to U.S. payrolls data at 8:30 a.m. ET, which is expected to show job growth slowed in January after December's weather-related outsized surge. 
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to increase by 165,000 jobs last month, according to a Reuters survey of economists, after shooting up 312,000 in December.
The jobs report comes at a time hundreds of thousands of federal workers who were furloughed are back at work following the recent partial government shutdown. The 35-day shutdown, which ended a week ago, may complicate the report but is not expected to have a lasting effect on U.S. employment or the economy.
At 7:16 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis  were up 4 points, or 0.02 percent. S&P 500 e-minis  were down 4 points, or 0.15 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were down 38 points, or 0.55 percent.
Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp  and Chevron Corp   rose slightly ahead of their results.
Honeywell International Inc  rose 1.7 percent after the industrial conglomerate forecast full-year earnings in a range that was largely above analysts' estimates. 
Cigna Corp  shares fell 2.7 percent after the health insurer forecast 2019 revenue and earnings below estimates. 
The insurer's shares, along with other pharmacy benefit managers took a hit after the U.S. government proposed a rule to end the industry-wide system of after-market discounts called rebates, which they get from drugmakers. 
CVS Health Corp  fell 2.4 percent.

By Divya R and Ankit Ajmera
Feb 1 (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc  on Friday forecast full-year earnings in a range that was largely above analysts' estimates, as the company benefited from robust demand for aircraft parts in a booming airline industry.
The company, which spun off its home and transportation businesses in the fourth quarter, said it was in a better position to focus on its more profitable businesses, including aerospace, as record orders for jets boosted demand for its aircraft parts.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
""We now have a simpler, more focused portfolio ... with about 60 percent of the (business) growing sales at or above 5 percent organically,"" Chief Executive Officer Darius Adamczyk said.
Honeywell forecast 2019 earnings in the range of $7.80 and $8.10 per share, while analysts were estimating a profit of $7.88 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Adamczyk said Honeywell's balance sheet was stronger post spin-offs and it had $14 billion in cash for possible acquisitions and share buybacks among other things. He, however, added that the company was not looking at ""large"" deals currently.
""The M&A pipeline is good, but we are conscious buyers, and we don't like to overpay,"" Adamczyk said.
Honeywell cautioned it was likely to grow at a slower rate in China this year, echoing downbeat sentiment at other manufacturing peers, including Caterpillar Inc  and 3M Co, which have warned of a profit hit due to the country's economic slowdown.
""We expect to grow in China in 2019 for certain. How much that's going to be? Well, we'll see,"" Adamczyk said. Honeywell reported a 9 percent sales growth in the region last year.
Overall, analysts were upbeat about Honeywell's ability to hit the top end of its full-year earnings forecast range, saying the company's strong balance sheet would act as a cushion against geopolitical uncertainties such as potential additional tariffs and Brexit.
""As usual, we believe that Honeywell is sticking with its historical DNA to 'under-promise, over-deliver' and would expect that the ranges have a sufficient level of conservatism baked in,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray said.
Excluding currency impacts, aerospace business sales rose 10 percent. Sales in the safety and productivity unit, which houses Honeywell's warehouse automation business, grew 15 percent.
Excluding items, the company, which makes everything from jet engines to catalysts used in petroleum and refining, earned $1.91 per share, beating estimates of $1.89 per share
Net sales fell 10.3 percent to $9.73 billion, factoring the impact of the two divestitures.

By Aditya Kalra and Sankalp Phartiyal
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - India's revised e-commerce rules caused widespread disruption on Amazon'sIndia website when they kicked in on Friday, forcing the company to take down its key grocery service and remove a wide range of products such as sunglasses and floor cleaners.
The products began to disappear from Amazon India late on Thursday as it began complying with the regulations before a midnight deadline, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
India's new e-commerce investment rules bar online retailers from selling products via vendors in which they have an equity interest, and also from making deals with sellers to sell exclusively on their platforms.
Numerous items sold by Amazon vendors such as Cloudtail, in which Amazon holds an indirect equity stake, were no longer available on its India site. Amazon Pantry, a grocery service primarily managed by company affiliates, was also discontinued, though grocery products could be purchased individually.
""Pantry is completely empty, how I am suppose to grocery shop,"" Twitter user Pamela wrote on the social network. ""Whatever government rules are, (I) don't care, you guys fix it, I need to shop.""
Amazon, which saw record sales and profit during the holiday season, has forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates due to the uncertainty in India - one of its key growth markets. 
The situation in India is ""a bit fluid right now,"" but the country remains a good long-term opportunity, Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said. The company's main goal was to minimize the impact of the new rules on customers and sellers, he added.
Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy warned last month that it faced ""significant customer disruption"" if the new rules were implemented from Feb. 1. On Friday, the company said it was disappointed the government acted in ""haste"", but assured compliance. 
""We are committed to doing everything we can to be compliant with the new rules,"" Flipkart India executive Rajneesh Kumar said in a statement, without explaining how the website was impacted.


POLITICS, INVESTOR SETBACK
The new policy was announced after complaints from small Indian traders who said the e-commerce giants used their control over inventory from affiliated vendors to create an unfair marketplace where they could offer discounts. Such arrangements will now be barred.
Both Amazon and Walmart unsuccessfully lobbied against the latest rules and pushed for a delay in their implementation. The U.S. government too urged India to protect the investments of the two retailers, Reuters reported last week. 
But Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration stood firm as the move was widely seen as one to appease small traders in the run-up to a general election due by May.
Industry sources have said the new rules will dent foreign investor sentiment and force the big online retailers to change their business structures, raising compliance costs. 
""The company has no choice as they are fulfilling a compliance requirement, the customers will suffer,"" said one of the sources. ""It is very upsetting for foreign investors.""
Both companies have bet heavily on India being a big growth driver: Amazon has committed to investing $5.5 billion there, while Walmart last year spent $16 billion on Flipkart.
Amazon's own range of Presto-branded home cleaning goods and other Amazon Basics products such as chargers and batteries vanished from its website late on Thursday.
Clothing from Indian department store chain Shopper's Stop  was also no longer available, as Amazon owns 5 percent of the company.
The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which supported tougher scrutiny of large e-commerce players, said the removal of products by Amazon was a step in the ""right direction"".
Exclusive deals with sellers, in compliance with the revised rules, will also be discontinued on Amazon India, the two sources said.
It was unclear how long the disruption will last. On Friday, Amazon's own range of Echo smart speakers, which were earlier removed as they were sold by a company affiliate, returned for sale via other sellers on the platform.
However, buyers would now need to wait for up to 36 days to get some of the speakers delivered even under Amazon's fast-delivery Prime service, which often delivers goods in a day or two.

192,"January 31, 2019, 11:23:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Amazon Beat Its Sales Guidance Over the Holidays in 2018,"
 E-commerce and cloud-computing giant   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) published an earnings report after the closing   bell on Thursday, covering the fourth quarter and full fiscal   year of 2018. Here's what you need to know right away about this   important holiday-quarter report. Amazon's fourth quarter by the numbers     Metric   Q4 2018makeArticleAd();   Q4 2017   Year-Over-Year Change       Net sales   $72.4 billion   $60.5 billion   20%     Operating income   $3.79 billion   $2.13 billion   78%     Net income   $3.35 billion   $1.87 billion   79%     GAAP earnings per share (diluted)   $6.04   $3.75   61%     Data source: Amazon.com. Amazon's free cash flows rose 43% year over year to $13.4   billion. Trailing cash flows for the full fiscal year landed at   $19.4 billion, 134% above the result seen in 2017. This was the   result of 67% higher operating cash flows and a restrained   investment policy where capital expenses grew by 13%. Amazon's stated long-term goal is to optimize its free cash   flows. Since management places a lot of weight on this metric,   analysts and investors are also paying extra-close attention to   it.   Image source: Amazon.com.  Highlights  Amazon's fourth-quarter guidance    called for roughly 15% revenue growth with top-line sales in the   neighborhood of $69.5 billion. Operating income was aimed at   roughly $2.7 billion. The company beat both of these targets with   room to spare.  North American retail sales rose 18% year over year to     $44.1 billion. Operating profits from Amazon's largest division     stopped at $2.25 billion, 33% above the year-ago period's. International e-commerce sales increased by 15% to $20.9     billion. The growth rate expands to 19% if you prefer to adjust     the numbers for currency exchange effects. This segment showed     an operating loss of $642 million, 30% below the year-ago     period's $919 million. The cloud-computing service known as     Amazon Web Services      , or AWS, accounted for 10.3% of Amazon's total sales at $7.43     billion. That's a 45% year-over-year increase. Operating     profits in this bucket rose 61% to $2.18 billion. The company did not provide any new details on the Amazon     Prime program's subscriber counts or revenue contributions,     other than pointing out that ""more customers signed up for     Prime worldwide in 2018 than ever before."" The same     record-breaking trend held true for the fourth quarter as well.     Since the revenue from Prime subscriptions is split between the     company's product and service segments in unknowable     proportions, it's hard to reach any firm conclusions about this     streaming video and free shipping program. CEO Jeff Bezos aimed his entire collection of prepared     remarks at extolling the virtues of the Amazon Alexa digital     assistant tool and its associated hardware devices. The     Alexa-powered Echo Dot gadget was the best-selling product on     Amazon's global e-commerce platforms in 2018. Amazon's commitment to a minimum wage of $15 per hour     kicked in on Nov. 1 and was in effect for two-thirds of the     fourth-quarter reporting period. The wage increase did not     result in out-of-control operating expenses, and nearly every     reportable portion of those costs showed a slower increase in     the fourth quarter than in the year as a whole. That's actually     a break from last year when Amazon's operating costs rose     faster in the year-ending period than in the full-year     view.  Looking ahead In the first quarter of 2019, Amazon's management expects to   show roughly $58 billion in top-line revenue. That would be   something like 14% above the same period of 2018, and the   guidance includes an expected currency exchange headwind of   approximately 2.1%. Operating income should rise by roughly 47%,   landing near $2.8 billion. On the       earnings call    , CFO Brian Olsavsky explained that 2018's low capital expenses   represented Amazon ""banking the efficiencies of investments in   people, warehouses, infrastructure that we had put in place in   2016 and 2017."" In 2019 and beyond, Amazon is switching back to a   heavier capital investment mode, which means larger capital   expenses and, thus, perhaps slimmer free cash flows over the next   couple of years. Again, everyone from Amazon's upper management to ordinary   investors keeps a close eye on the company's cash flow trends.   This directional statement looks like a useful signpost along   Amazon's road to long-term growth.

Good day everyone and welcome to   the Amazon.Com Q4 2018 financial results teleconference. At this   time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the   presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session.   Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be   turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Dave   Fildes. Please go ahead.  Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  Hello and welcome to our Q4 2018 financial results conference   call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian   Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we   encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which   includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary   on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all   comparisons in this call will be against our results for the   comparable period of 2017. Our comments and responses to your   questions reflect management's views as of today, January 31st,   2019, only. And will include forward-looking statements. Actual   results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially   impact our financial results is included in today's press release   and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent annual   report on Form 10K and subsequent filings. During this call, we   may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our press   release, slides accompanying this webcast, and our filings with   the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website.

Click here to get access to the full       list!   *Stock Advisor returns as of November 14, 2018   Our guidance incorporates the older trends that we've seen to   date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our   results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially   affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign   exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and   customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the   internet, online commerce and cloud services, and various factors   detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes, among other things, that we don't   conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments,   restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to   accurately predict demand for our goods and services and   therefore our actual results could differ materially from our   guidance. With that, we'll move to Q&A. Operator, please   remind our listeners how to initiate a question. Questions and Answers:  Operator  At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. We   ask each caller; please limit yourself to one question. If you   would like to ask a question, please press *1 on your keypad. We   ask that when you pose your question, you pick up your handsets   to provide optimum sound quality. Once again, to initiate a   question, please press * then 1 on your touchtone telephone at   this time. Please hold while we pull for your questions. Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Justin   Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.  Justin Post -- Merrill Lynch -- Analyst  Great, thank you. I guess I'll ask about units; 14% in the   quarter. How do you feel about the overall unit growth here given   that growth was higher last year in the 20s? Do you think there's   some investments you can make in other areas to kinda   reaccelerate that going forward? And then secondly, just if you could remind us or help us   understand the Prime accounting change impact on subscription   revenues in Q4? Thank you.  Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  Hey, Justin, this is Dave. Just on the second question on the   subscription services; we'd said on the last call, you probably   remember, related to the adoption of the accounting standards   update in revenue recognition policies that was impacting our   results in a number of areas in 2018. We'd said we'd anticipated   about 300 million lower sorta headwind to subscription services   revenue due to the accounting change. So that's where we came out for the quarter. You'll see that   we reported subscription services revenue increased 26% when you   exclude FX. So, the 300 million is certainly a part of that   decelerate -- the sequential deceleration in the growth rate   in-line item.  Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah, on unit deceleration; I think the unit numbers more and   more require some interpretation because it doesn't include some   of our fastest growing areas. Things like, as Dave mentioned,   subscription services, AWS, advertising, Whole Foods, units are   not in that number. So, we don't focus as much on the number. I   would direct you more to the supplemental revenue guidance that   breaks up the component parts. But in general, we feel good about the growth in the quarter.   We think it was a Q4, in particular, was a great quarter for   customers -- there's a lot of strength in the retail part of the   businesses. The teams here had done a great job planning,   preparing, and then executing on the quarter. AWS maintained a   very strong growth rate and continued to deliver for customers   and we had a great reinvent conference in the quarter. We feel   good about the growth in the quarter and also the total revenue   income.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark   Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your   question.  Mark Mahaney -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst  Thanks. You want to just comment a little bit on the   international revenue outlook in any commentary on India and   whether you think there's a material impact on your business?   Secondly, could you talk about advertising revenue? Just the   qualitatively or quantitatively how that's doing? And third, if I   could; you spent a lot on marketing in the quarter. It's a real   step up. Do you just want to talk about the ROI that you think   you're getting on that marketing spend? Thanks a lot.  Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Sure, Mark. The first questions on India, let me start with   that. So, we have incorporated into our guidance estimate -- the   best estimate we have for Q1 in India. However, there's much   uncertainty as to what the impact to the government rule changes   is gonna have on the e-commerce sector there. We remain committed   to complying with all laws and regulations, we will. But we're evaluating the situation. Our main issue and our   main concern is trying to minimize the impact to our customers   and sellers in India. We've built our business around price   selection and convenience. We don't think the changes help in   those dimensions for both the customers in India and also the   sellers. Dave, why don't you talk about the advertising   growth?  Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  Yeah, yeah. I mean, we're continuing to -- there's a lot of   focus on serving that customer set. One of the things we're   trying to do is continually evolve our tools and the products to   help that customer set -- agencies, advertisers, make sure   they've got a variety of ways to meet their goals. Some of the   things we've done more recently over the last few months or so is   expanded sponsor brands placements, some rolled out new campaign   reports, and proof campaign manager features. So, there's a number of things beyond that. But features out   there that are just gonna make it easier for companies to grow   with the ad tools and the ad services that we offer. And we're   continually excited about the opportunity there. And then on your   question on marketing, yes, the marketing percent of revenue was   up 110 basis points year-over-year. This category also includes   AWS sales and marketing. Keep that in mind because that's where a lot of our headcount   investment is going. Headcount only grew 14% year-over-year. But   the areas that were growing in that mix were things like;   technology teams, device areas, AWS, especially sales and   marketing. Variable marketing was pretty consistent with prior   periods and we feel good about our return investment on the   marketing, the variable marketing.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug   Anmuth with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.  Doug Anmuth -- JP Morgan -- Analyst  Great, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on India. Just   bigger picture, Brian. Did the new policies change your view at   all of the attractiveness or the potential of operating in India   and how do you think about your investment strategy there in the   near term? And then also just hoping you could talk about some of   the impact in the US and UK from free shipping during the fourth   quarter holidays. Thanks.  Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah. Really, we're still evaluating the situation in India.   We feel very good about the long-term prospects in India and   doing a good job for both Indian customers and Indian sellers.   The new regulations need to be interpreted, need to make sure   they don't have unintended consequences. And again, don't think   it's necessarily consistent with better price, better selection,   better convenience for the Indian customer. So, it's about all we   can say on that topic right now.  Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  And I think, Doug, your second point was just around shipping   -- some of the shipping offers on the holiday. We did lower the   free shipping threshold headed into the fourth quarter, so   customers took advantage of that. That was a great offer for them   in the holidays. Brian talked a little bit about it before but   pleased with the holiday season, both from sort of a first party   side but also sellers continue to do well. As part of the holiday offering, we sold a number of   record-breaking number of Alexa devices as well. And I think just   in that shipping vain, really pleased with the continued   engagement from Prime members. We had the most ever number of   Prime members sign up this quarter than any quarter we've had. So   really pleased with that.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark May   with Citi. Please proceed with your question.  Mark May -- Citi -- Analyst  Thank you. When I try to back out the impact of factors like   Whole Foods, the advertising accounting change, and other   factors, what I see is stable and pretty healthy revenue growth   in the retail segment, but a slowdown in Q4 from what seems to   have been in more recent quarters, meaningful gross margin   expansion in the retail segment. Can you discuss what may have driven that and how to think   about retail gross margins going forward? And then somewhat   separately, retail margins last year benefited from several   factors including more modest hiring and more modest growth in   fulfillment center capacity. Do you see these factors persisting   this year? Thanks.  Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah, thank you. Let me start with that last part because I   think if we step back and put 2018 in perspective, there's some   clear trends regarding our cost structure starting with   fulfillment costs. In the prior two years, 2016-2017, we had   grown our square footage tied to fulfillment in shipping by   greater than 30%. In 2018, that number grew by 15%. Certainly,   unit demand was lower, but AFN or Amazon fulfilled demand where   we've combined FBA and retail, remains strong. So, we had banking, if you will, of some large expansions in   the prior two years. Similarly, on headcount, we grew headcount   by 48% in 2016. 38% in 2017 if you exclude the acquisitions of   Whole Foods and Souq, which drove the number up to closer to 60%   I believe. Last year, we were at 14% growth. So, there was a lot   of leverage and a lot of -- in a way, there was a lot of   pre-hiring in 2017 that we digested in 2018 in some areas,   especially things like our core retail business and also G&A   function. But then we continued to invest again in the technology tied   to AWS, a sales team to the native US, the device area. There   were groups that were growing considerably higher than that 14%.   But in total, the company grew 14%. And then on capital,   especially infrastructure capital. If you use the capital lease   line as maybe an indicator for what we have invested into our AWS   business to support infrastructure and global expansion. That   number grew 10% last year when it had grown 69% in 2017. So, in a lot of ways, 2018 was about banking the efficiencies   of investments in people, warehouses, infrastructure, that we had   put in place in 2016 and 2017. What we'll continue to   concurrently drive growth in customer offering and Prime   benefits, we certainly do take cost seriously and we will   continue to work on operational efficiencies. I would expect   those investments to increase relative to 2018. And we've   reflected what we see so far in Q1 in our guidance.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath   Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.  Heath Terry -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst  Great. Thank you. A little bit -- to dig a little bit deeper   into the Capex capitally side of things. You guys have said in   the past that generally, you work to build in line with your   expectations for guidance or that you're trying not to over-build   or under-build when thinking about your fulfillment and data   center capacity. We saw that investment reaccelerates in the fourth quarter   after hitting the lows that you referenced in Q3. Anything to   read into that about sort of what your expectations are for   growth in those businesses seeing that reacceleration after the   deceleration that we saw over the course of at least the first   three quarters of last year?  Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah, I see total Capex that grew 33% in Q1, 1% in Q2, -1% in   Q3, and then +17% in Q4, just the quarter itself. So, there was,   as you say, a bit of investment in Q4 relative to Q2 and Q3. I   still think the 17% is a low number for us when you talk about   the supporting the AWS business that's still growing in a very   high clip and a very strong and healthy growth in FBA and   customer demand and our expansion into new countries, both with   AWS and also with our core consumer business. I'm not prepared to give you the forecast for the year right   now. I would say that I would consider 2018 to be a lighter   investment year and the lighter year for adding fixed headcount.   Certainly, compared to 2016 and 2017, and we'll reveal that as we   go through the year, but we've built into the first quarter what   we expect in the first three months.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian   Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.  Brian Nowak -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst  Thanks for taking my questions, I have two. The first one is   to go back to the fourth quarter gross margins. I think if you   try to back on the AWS, it looks like there was a little more   gross margin pressure. Can you just talk to any of the puts and   takes we should know about from a gross margin perspective in the   fourth quarter? And then that other line that includes the   advertising business; could you just help us -- any help at all   on the growth of the advertising business or the impact of any of   the accounting changes in the quarter? Thanks.  Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah, sure. I'm sorry, I skipped over that gross margin   question earlier. Yeah, gross margins were well up 180 basis   points year-over-year. We're not up as much as prior quarters. I   would say the positive tailwinds still remain. AWS has strong   growth; 46% on an FX neutral basis. Third-party units continue to   grow. Advertising dollars continue to grow very well. Some of the   headwinds I would say were outbound shipping cost, including the   free shipping that we did. But mostly it was the higher Amazon   fulfilled units and the greater use of Amazon logistics. And I would also say retail was very strong. We had a -- I   think Dave mentioned -- the Echo Dot was the highest selling unit   globally. So, devices had very strong sales in the quarter. We   discussed how we don't price devices to make money, we usually   will expand our -- or content expanding our device and usage   throughout a group of customers who use our devices. And then we   monetize that in different ways to a commitment to Amazon and the   video and everything else. So, a bit of it was mix but I would   say this retail, which has a lower gross margin, more because the   revenue treatment was stronger in Q4.  Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  Yeah and just on the other revenue piece, Brian, just to get   back to the accounting side. We did adopt it, that revenue   recognition standard in 2018, as I mentioned. As part of the   adoption, certain advertising services were classified as revenue   rather than a reduction of cost of sales. Specific to Q4, the   impact of that change was an increase of approximately $1 billion   to other revenue. So, you'll see that in the other revenue, in   total.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin   Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your   question.  Colin Sebastian -- Robert W. Baird -- Analyst  Thanks. I guess two for me as well. In the quarter looking   backward, not considering India and the impact going forward, but   the international growth accelerated. So, I was curious, any   particular regions or product categories to call out? Especially   given some of the weakness in the UK. And then marketplace fees   are changing in several categories, including home furnishings,   health, and beauty. Curious what the strategy is there. I assumed   you expand the selection. But is it also an indication of an   increasing focus on those retail categories? Thanks.  Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Sure, let me start with your second question. Obviously,   third-party sellers are an important part of our value   proposition. They've had great success on our site. More than   half of our units sold are from third-party sellers. It's very   important to us that we have the right business profile, both for   Amazon and for the sellers. We will always be evolving that; part   of that involves changing fee structures, sometimes adding new   fees or subtracting old ones. Part of it involves raising or   lowering fees that sellers pay. You're gonna see this continually   from us. We generally work to change the fees to make sure that the   incentives are strong on both sides and we continue to have a   healthy growth in third-party. On the international, on an FX   neutral basis, the growth was 15% in Q3 and 19% in Q4. But the   last call, if you remember, I talked about the timing of Diwali   and the impact that had on our growth rates. If we adjust for   that -- and again, Diwali had placed primarily in Q4 this year   and it was split between Q3 and Q4 last year. If we adjust for   that, international growth is pretty flat Q3-Q4.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd   Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your   question.  Lloyd Walmsley -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst  Thanks. Two if I can. First just on the advertising side. We   hear a lot of positive feedback from customers but also, we hear   suggestions there are supply constraints. How do you guys see   inventory growth versus pricing growth as a driver in that   business and are there things you can do to grow inventory? And   then, secondly, there've been some reports -- your Amazon   shipping effort is kind of expanding beyond some test markets.   So, wondering if you can give us a sense for what you've seen in   those test markets and how you think about expanding your   shipping efforts on that productized basis going forward?   Thanks.  Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  Yeah, Lloyd, thanks for the questions. I'll take the   advertising piece first. I think as I talked before, we're   working on the improving usability of tools. Our priorities in   this space, that's certainly one of them, looking for ways to   make smarter recommendations, addressing the needs of brands,   automating activities, inventing new products. And I think in all   those regards in those priorities we think there's some good   growth to continue to come both in advertising for on our   properties but also potentially beyond over the longer term. Given as we look for advertising opportunities on places like   Amazon.Com, we think there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of   experimentation. I think we're learning and are a very data   interested company and working with a lot of great brands to be   able to develop better toolkits for them, understand what types   of metrics they want to make them more successful based on what   they're telling us.  Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah and on transportation, I assume you're just talking about   our expansion of Amazon, deliveries in Amazon logistics. Again,   we have great partners in place for our business and support   globally. What we do is add capacity where we feel we need to   speed up service or ensure demand, particularly at peak. So, we will continue to build out our DSP or inflex and ship   with Amazon programs. So, during the quarter, it was a much   bigger presence obviously year-over-year. We're happy with that,   both from a performance standpoint to delivery estimate accuracy   as we call it, very strong on our self-delivered products and   also the cost profiles, very good as well.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric   Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question.  Eric Sheridan -- UBS -- Analyst  Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. One, on   the media side; has there been any step up in terms of   investments around media content to support your ambition to the   prospective Prime and video? It's been a couple of years now   since we got an update on the rate of spend or how it might   impact either historical periods or going forward periods. That   would be number one. And then number two, going back to Lloyd's question on the   advertising front; how do you think about the video opportunity   and moving beyond just branded opportunities or sponsored product   search on your own properties and thinking about experimenting   with over the top video or connected TV opportunities that might   sit in front of you going forward? Thanks so much.  Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Let me start with video. We're not quantifying the Prime video   spend today but we do -- it has been increasing and we expect it   to increase even further in 2019. We aren't seeing a lot of,   again, continued strong adoption in the usage and viewing and   hours watched of our both our music and our streaming video and   music. And it's a step back at -- it builds stronger Prime   connectivity with our Prime members, at least the higher   membership renewal rates and higher overall engagement. And we like what we see. We continue to see that engagement   growing. I would say that we've had some particular success   recently with ten Golden Globe nominations and three Oscar   nominations; and Jack Ryan, Homecoming, and season two of The   Marvelous Mrs. Maisel in particular were very well received   during the quarter.  Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  And then on your second question just around advertising   opportunities and around video. You may have seen not that long   ago, IMDB internet movie database, one of our subsidiaries,   launched Freedive, which is an ad-supported free streaming video   channel that's available in the US. It enables customers to watch   hit TV shows and movies without purchasing a subscription --   ad-supported. That's available on the IMDB website with your   laptop or personal computer. I think it's definitely on the Fire TV devices as well as a   great way to consume content. So, I think excited about that.   Other opportunities we've been working within ads and video for a   bit longer period of time have been things like our sports   offerings, some of the live sports that we've done; things like   Thursday night football. Really like the success that we've seen   on those and been learning from that looking forward to pursuing   more opportunities to engage and serve with customers those types   of video offers but also take some opportunity to monetize with   the advertising.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason   Helfstein with Oppenheimer, please proceed with your   question.  Jason Helfstein -- Oppenheimer -- Analyst  Thanks. Just two. Just can you comment; did advertising   slowdown relative to the third quarter? One, you kinda adjusting   for 606. And then secondly, was there any reallocation in   segments between online and physical stores? And if not, any   commentary on why physical stores was down year-over-year?   Thanks.  Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah, thanks Jason for your questions. Let me start with the   physical stores' revenues. Physical stores decreased 3%   year-over-year, and this is primarily Whole Foods but also   includes our other stores, the Amazon bookstores, Amazon Go,   Amazon 4-star. What happened in the quarter was we were lapping a   period last year when we had purchased Whole Foods in Q3, as you   remember, of 2017. In Q4 we adjusted their fiscal calendar to   link it up with Amazon's, and it added about five days of revenue   into Q4 of last year. So, we're comping that year-over-year. The second piece is that the, as you said, the online orders   where people go to the prior no app and then order for delivery   or pick up at Whole Foods stores, does count or is counted in the   online stores component of revenue. So, if you adjust for those,   with the Whole Foods growth year-over-year on an apples-to-apples   basis was approximately 6%. Because of some of those, again,   mostly the year-over-year counting or days true up issue. It's   showing up as -3% in physical stores.  Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  And then just on your second question around advertising. If   you look at the other revenue, the growth rate decelerated some.   So, it's 97%; still very strong year-over-year growth in the   fourth quarter. In other revenue, as I think you're aware, there   are a number of components but the largest by a good margin is   the advertising revenue. And we are comping a period of rapid   growth in the prior year. That is a part of the factor there as   you mentioned. But I just reiterate; we're continuing to see   quite strong adoption across Amazon's vendors, sellers, authors,   all types of advertisers that are utilizing that.  Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon   with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.  Dan Salmon -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst  Good afternoon, everyone. Brain, can you just return to your   comment earlier about the increased use of Amazon logistics, not   a surprise there, but just curious through the holiday season;   any particular learnings that you could offer some color on and   how you view the balance between using your own proprietary   logistics versus third parties as you go into 2019? And then just a quick follow-up, obviously, the HQ2 news came   out during the quarter. What would you highlight as maybe the   most important next steps there? And maybe some color on the   feedback from that process; would be interested to hear that as   well. Thank you.  Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah, sure. So, let's start with HQ2. Of course, in November   we announced we selected New York City and northern Virginia, and   between the two cities we'll be investing $5 billion and creating   more than 50,000 jobs. We also announced an operation center of   excellence to be opened up in Nashville, which is about estimated   to be about 5,000 jobs. Right now, we're working through some   next issues in both cities. We're looking forward to investing in New York and northern   Virginia and being a good community partner, as well as   Nashville. So not really much else to report at this time on   that. On your comment or question on transportation; yeah, we do   continue to expand our Amazon logistics and our delivery   capability, and it also matches up with our faster ship speed   that we're seeing for Prime members as well. We added, of course,   we have over 100 million items that customers can get within two   days. But there's now over 3 million that will be delivered   within one day or faster in 10,000 cities and towns. So, Amazon deliveries are a big part of that. Again, we have   great third-party partners as well in the transportation space.   What we like about our ability to participate in transportation   is that a lot of times we can do it at the same costs or better   and we like the cost profile of it, too. We can also invest   selectively because we have more perfect information. We know   where our demand is, we know where we're moving things between   warehouses and sort centers. And by not involving third parties   all the time, we found that we can extend our order cut-offs and   we've done that over the last few years. So that's also another   helpful side benefit for consumers when we are doing our own   logistics -- excuse me, transportation, final delivery.'  Operator  Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Ross   Sandler with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.  Ross Sandler -- Barclays -- Analyst  Great. Thanks, guys. So, the AWS operating margins   historically kinda move around a bit. Any color on what drove the   decline sequentially from Q3 to Q4? And then I guess going back   to the investment catch up team. Sounds like 2019 will be a   little bit more aggressive push from you guys. Can you parse out   whether you expect that the pace of retail margin expansion that   we're seeing in North America right now; is that gonna continue   and most of these investments are gonna be into international and   some of the stuff going on in India? Any color on the North   American operating margin trajectory, thanks.  Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah, sure. Let me start with the AWS operating margin as   you've called it out. That number will move around. We're very   pleased with the 29.3% that we saw during the quarter. Of course,   at any point in time, this business is gonna be a combination of   lowering prices, expanding geographically, adding people to build   -- especially tech teams and sales teams to build new and   innovative products and staying very relevant and ahead in our   customers' minds. And infrastructure, again, it'll bounce between quarters a   bit. Our capital lease expenditure in Q4 was a bit higher than   the prior three quarters that had a slight impact on the   operating margin. But again, year-over-year operating margins   were up and were almost 280 basis points. We've said quite openly   that this is going to bounce around. What we do is create value   for the customer on one end, and then work to minimize our cost   of infrastructure. And we're getting more and more creative   around getting efficiency up and getting our cost of acquisition   down.  Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your   questions. A replay will be available on our investor relations   site at least through the end of the quarter.

Good day everyone and welcome to   the Amazon.Com Q4 2018 financial results teleconference.
Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  Hello and welcome to our Q4 2018 financial results conference   call.
As you listen to today's conference call, we   encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which   includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary   on the quarter.
Our   results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially   affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign   exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and   customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the   internet, online commerce and cloud services, and various factors   detailed in our filings with the SEC.
And then secondly, just if you could remind us or help us   understand the Prime accounting change impact on subscription   revenues in Q4?
Just on the second question on the   subscription services; we'd said on the last call, you probably   remember, related to the adoption of the accounting standards   update in revenue recognition policies that was impacting our   results in a number of areas in 2018.
Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah, on unit deceleration; I think the unit numbers more and   more require some interpretation because it doesn't include some   of our fastest growing areas.
Things like, as Dave mentioned,   subscription services, AWS, advertising, Whole Foods, units are   not in that number.
But in general, we feel good about the growth in the quarter.
We think it was a Q4, in particular, was a great quarter for   customers -- there's a lot of strength in the retail part of the   businesses.
AWS maintained a   very strong growth rate and continued to deliver for customers   and we had a great reinvent conference in the quarter.
We feel   good about the growth in the quarter and also the total revenue   income.
Our next question comes from the line of Mark   Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
You want to just comment a little bit on the   international revenue outlook in any commentary on India and   whether you think there's a material impact on your business?
We don't think the changes help in   those dimensions for both the customers in India and also the   sellers.
One of the things we're   trying to do is continually evolve our tools and the products to   help that customer set -- agencies, advertisers, make sure   they've got a variety of ways to meet their goals.
And then on your   question on marketing, yes, the marketing percent of revenue was   up 110 basis points year-over-year.
Did the new policies change your view at   all of the attractiveness or the potential of operating in India   and how do you think about your investment strategy there in the   near term?
Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  And I think, Doug, your second point was just around shipping   -- some of the shipping offers on the holiday.
Brian talked a little bit about it before but   pleased with the holiday season, both from sort of a first party   side but also sellers continue to do well.
We had the most ever number of   Prime members sign up this quarter than any quarter we've had.
Our next question comes from the line of Mark May   with Citi.
When I try to back out the impact of factors like   Whole Foods, the advertising accounting change, and other   factors, what I see is stable and pretty healthy revenue growth   in the retail segment, but a slowdown in Q4 from what seems to   have been in more recent quarters, meaningful gross margin   expansion in the retail segment.
And then somewhat   separately, retail margins last year benefited from several   factors including more modest hiring and more modest growth in   fulfillment center capacity.
Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah, thank you.
Certainly,   unit demand was lower, but AFN or Amazon fulfilled demand where   we've combined FBA and retail, remains strong.
If you use the capital lease   line as maybe an indicator for what we have invested into our AWS   business to support infrastructure and global expansion.
What we'll continue to   concurrently drive growth in customer offering and Prime   benefits, we certainly do take cost seriously and we will   continue to work on operational efficiencies.
We saw that investment reaccelerates in the fourth quarter   after hitting the lows that you referenced in Q3.
Anything to   read into that about sort of what your expectations are for   growth in those businesses seeing that reacceleration after the   deceleration that we saw over the course of at least the first   three quarters of last year?
Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah, I see total Capex that grew 33% in Q1, 1% in Q2, -1% in   Q3, and then +17% in Q4, just the quarter itself.
I   still think the 17% is a low number for us when you talk about   the supporting the AWS business that's still growing in a very   high clip and a very strong and healthy growth in FBA and   customer demand and our expansion into new countries, both with   AWS and also with our core consumer business.
Certainly, compared to 2016 and 2017, and we'll reveal that as we   go through the year, but we've built into the first quarter what   we expect in the first three months.
Our next question comes from the line of Brian   Nowak with Morgan Stanley.
Brian Nowak -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst  Thanks for taking my questions, I have two.
I think if you   try to back on the AWS, it looks like there was a little more   gross margin pressure.
And then that other line that includes the   advertising business; could you just help us -- any help at all   on the growth of the advertising business or the impact of any of   the accounting changes in the quarter?
So, a bit of it was mix but I would   say this retail, which has a lower gross margin, more because the   revenue treatment was stronger in Q4.
Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  Yeah and just on the other revenue piece, Brian, just to get   back to the accounting side.
In the quarter looking   backward, not considering India and the impact going forward, but   the international growth accelerated.
Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Sure, let me start with your second question.
We generally work to change the fees to make sure that the   incentives are strong on both sides and we continue to have a   healthy growth in third-party.
And   then, secondly, there've been some reports -- your Amazon   shipping effort is kind of expanding beyond some test markets.
So, wondering if you can give us a sense for what you've seen in   those test markets and how you think about expanding your   shipping efforts on that productized basis going forward?
Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  Yeah, Lloyd, thanks for the questions.
And I think in all   those regards in those priorities we think there's some good   growth to continue to come both in advertising for on our   properties but also potentially beyond over the longer term.
Given as we look for advertising opportunities on places like   Amazon.Com, we think there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of   experimentation.
Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah and on transportation, I assume you're just talking about   our expansion of Amazon, deliveries in Amazon logistics.
Eric Sheridan -- UBS -- Analyst  Thanks for taking the question.
And then number two, going back to Lloyd's question on the   advertising front; how do you think about the video opportunity   and moving beyond just branded opportunities or sponsored product   search on your own properties and thinking about experimenting   with over the top video or connected TV opportunities that might   sit in front of you going forward?
Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  And then on your second question just around advertising   opportunities and around video.
Other opportunities we've been working within ads and video for a   bit longer period of time have been things like our sports   offerings, some of the live sports that we've done; things like   Thursday night football.
Really like the success that we've seen   on those and been learning from that looking forward to pursuing   more opportunities to engage and serve with customers those types   of video offers but also take some opportunity to monetize with   the advertising.
Brian Olsavsky -- Chief Financial Officer  Yeah, thanks Jason for your questions.
What happened in the quarter was we were lapping a   period last year when we had purchased Whole Foods in Q3, as you   remember, of 2017.
In Q4 we adjusted their fiscal calendar to   link it up with Amazon's, and it added about five days of revenue   into Q4 of last year.
Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  And then just on your second question around advertising.
So, it's 97%; still very strong year-over-year growth in the   fourth quarter.
In other revenue, as I think you're aware, there   are a number of components but the largest by a good margin is   the advertising revenue.
But I just reiterate; we're continuing to see   quite strong adoption across Amazon's vendors, sellers, authors,   all types of advertisers that are utilizing that.
Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon   with BMO Capital Markets.
On your comment or question on transportation; yeah, we do   continue to expand our Amazon logistics and our delivery   capability, and it also matches up with our faster ship speed   that we're seeing for Prime members as well.
Can you parse out   whether you expect that the pace of retail margin expansion that   we're seeing in North America right now; is that gonna continue   and most of these investments are gonna be into international and   some of the stuff going on in India?
Of course,   at any point in time, this business is gonna be a combination of   lowering prices, expanding geographically, adding people to build   -- especially tech teams and sales teams to build new and   innovative products and staying very relevant and ahead in our   customers' minds.
Our capital lease expenditure in Q4 was a bit higher than   the prior three quarters that had a slight impact on the   operating margin.
Dave Fildes -- Director of Investor Relations  Thanks for joining us on the call today and for your   questions.
We appreciate your   interest in Amazon and look forward to talking with you again   next quarter.

194,"January 31, 2019, 09:36:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,6 Metrics Highlight Amazon's Fourth Quarter,"
  Amazon    's (NASDAQ: AMZN) fourth-quarter results are out. Though revenue   growth decelerated as expected, the top-line figure came in at   the high end of management's guidance for the metric. In   addition, the company continued to demonstrate its ability to   grow its bottom line rapidly. Here's a look at key figures from the quarter, including the   company's double-digit revenue, surging cloud-computing business,   revenue guidance, and more.   Image source: Amazon.com.makeArticleAd();   $72.4 billion  Amazon's fourth-quarter revenue rose 20% year over year, to   $72.4 billion. This metric was at the high end of management's   guidance for fourth-quarter revenue to rise 10% to 20% year over   year to between $66.5 billion and $72.5 billion. But revenue growth continued to decelerate compared to   previous quarters. Amazon's fourth-quarter revenue growth rate   was down from 29% year-over-year revenue growth in the third   quarter of 2018. Some of this sequential deceleration can be   explained by the fact that this was the first quarter in which   Amazon was up against a full period of Whole Foods sales in the   year-ago quarter. Notably, when excluding revenue from physical   stores (a revenue category that primarily consists of Whole   Foods), revenue rose 21% year over year during the quarter.  5.2%  Amazon's operating margin, or operating income as a percentage   of revenue, swelled to 5.2% -- up from 3.5% in the year-ago   quarter. This was driven by outsize revenue growth in   Amazon's higher-margin businesses    , namely Amazon Web Services.  $3 billion  Net income for the quarter was $3 billion, up from $1.9   billion in the year-ago quarter.

 On the surface,   Amazon's    (NASDAQ: AMZN) earnings report looked like another strong quarter   as the company beat both its own guidance and analyst estimates.   Revenue increased 20% to $72.4 billion and earnings per share   rose from an adjusted $2.16 a year ago to $6.04. For most companies, 20% revenue growth would be worth   celebrating, but for Amazon that pace marked its slowest top-line   growth in more than three years. It's been more than a year since   the Whole Foods acquisition, Prime membership is approaching a   saturation point     and the company is facing the law of large numbers.   Amazon's days of blockbuster growth appear   to be ending    .   Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();  Its e-commerce growth was actually worse than the 20% overall   clip because that was juiced by 45% growth in Amazon Web Services   (AWS), the company's cloud computing division. Amazon's North American e-commerce revenue increased 18%, but   that was barely faster than the 16.5% rate that   Adobe    Analytics said overall United States e-commerce revenue expanded   in November and December. In other words, Amazon's online   sales are essentially growing at the pace of the industry. That   may be the clearest sign yet that increasing competition from   retailers such as   Walmart    and   Target    are having an impact on Amazon's growth. Though their online   sales are much smaller than Amazon's, both companies have been   posting e-commerce revenue growth in recent quarters, increasing   their market share. Neither Walmart nor Target has reported   fourth-quarter results yet. Amazon's direct sales were up just 13% in the quarter, slower   than the overall e-commerce growth rate in the U.S. Ordinarily,   that would be cause for concern, but Amazon is shifting focus to   other businesses, downplaying the need for growth in its core   e-commerce segment.  Changing the game  With direct sales slowing, Amazon is moving on to   faster-growing high-margin businesses like its third-party   marketplace, AWS, and advertising. Revenue from third-party   seller services jumped 27% to $13.4 billion in the fourth   quarter, and third-party sellers made up 52% of units sold on   Amazon. AWS revenue increased 45% to $7.4 billion, driving its   operating income up 61% to $2.1 billion. In its other segment,   which primarily consists of advertising, revenue nearly doubled,   increasing 97% to $3.4 billion as the company took advantage of   high demand during the holiday season. Amazon's subscription services revenue, led by Prime, also   showed strong growth, up 25% to $3.9 billion, though that growth   was boosted by the   price increase     for U.S. Prime subscribers that went into effect in May   2018. The results in these other businesses show Amazon is reaping   the benefits of the massive investments it made in its   fulfillment network and the infrastructure needed to run AWS.   Headcount increased just 14% during the year, a sign that its   fulfillment center expansion has slowed significantly, which has   helped to leverage its recent revenue growth. That's allowed the   company to finally deliver significant profits on its bottom   line. The question for investors now is if Amazon can grow profits   fast enough to make up for slowing revenue growth as the company   forecast a sales increase of just 10%-18% in the current quarter.   Meanwhile, the company's competitors continue to invest in faster   shipping and their own e-commerce infrastructure, and many of   Amazon's sellers would be happy to see another online marketplace   challenge its supremacy. Even with a fast-growing bottom line, the stock remains pricey   and therefore vulnerable to any missed expectations.

196,"January 31, 2019, 07:47:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Amazon's Move Against MongoDB Doesn't Worry Me,"
   On Jan. 10, the day after   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) unveiled DocumentDB, a cloud-accessible   MongoDB    (NASDAQ: MDB)  database-service clone built for Amazon Web   Services (AWS), the upstart database provider's stock   fell by more than 13%    . Three weeks later, you'd hardly know there was a slide. MongoDB   stock is trading for a slight premium to where it stood before   the Amazon-induced haircut. Color me unsurprised.makeArticleAd(); Amazon is effectively pitching customers on using AWS to get   the best of MongoDB when there's already a more functional   version of the database available on not only AWS but also on   Google Cloud and   Microsoft    's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure. It's called Atlas, and last quarter this   cloud version of MongoDB accounted for 22% of MongoDB's revenue.   Total cloud revenue from Atlas soared 300% year over year in the   third quarter. The following chart shows what Amazon is after with DocumentDB   -- replacing or enhancing the majority of Mongo deployments   hosted on-site or co-located in a data center.   Image source: Amazon.com.  Why would Amazon want to do this? MongoDB makes the world's   leading NoSQL database, meaning it's capable of handling   unstructured data such as images as easily as it handles numbers   and other common data types. Mongo differs from, say,   Oracle    (NYSE: ORCL) in that it stores information in ""documents"" instead   of the columns and rows of a traditional relational database.   That inherent flexibility means there's no ""structured query   language"" for retrieving data from the system -- hence the term   ""NoSQL."" There's just one problem with this scenario: Amazon's version   of DocumentDB uses the old 3.6 version of the MongoDB server that   operates under a more wide-ranging open-source license. A newer   version is licensed under the Server Side Public License, which   means that those who use, modify, and redeploy the free version   of Mongo, known as Community Server, as a Web-hosted service   must also make their work freely available to others as   open-source software.  Let's say Amazon made significant changes to the newest   Community Server, beefing it up to handle all sorts of heavy-duty   online processes to make it more valuable to businesses. Awesome,   right? Absolutely, especially for business users getting a free   database from Amazon. MongoDB, too, would benefit. Engineers   there would download the newly enhanced DocumentDB for   incorporating everything useful into a new version of Community   Server, also without paying Amazon a dime. This is why MongoDB chief executive Dev Ittycheria responded   to the news flippantly. ""Imitation is the sincerest form of   flattery, so it's not surprising that Amazon would try to   capitalize on the popularity and momentum of MongoDB,"" he   said in a statement supplied to CNBC. ""However, developers are   savvy enough to distinguish between the real thing and a poor   imitation."" With MongoDB, you can't drop ACID As a shareholder, I'd rather have seen Ittycheria respond with   more grace and less snark. But he's also right: Amazon is using   old technology that's freely available in Community Server, which   has already been downloaded over 40 million times. And since   DocumentDB is native to AWS, it makes little sense to use it   unless you're already working with a vast amount of data in   Amazon's cloud. Even then, DocumentDB isn't as functional as the   commercial-grade version of MongoDB that more than 8,300   customers worldwide use. We know because it's only the commercial   version of Mongo -- not the free Community Server on which   DocumentDB is based -- that supports ""ACID"" transactions across   multiple documents. ACID -- short for ""atomicity, consistency, isolation,   durability"" -- is a set of properties that modern,   enterprise-scale databases adhere to for ensuring the validity of   transactions. So, for example, a bank wouldn't use anything less   than an ACID-tested database for arranging and tracking cash   disbursements from an ATM network. A retailer would want an   ACID-tested database for following the movement of inventory. And   a subscription business would want an ACID-tested database for   tracking the comings and goings of its subscriber base to avoid   billing errors. DocumentDB offers none of these assurances today,   and it may never. Low expectations = lots of room to grow You'd think that would make Mongo an attractive choice in the   enterprise IT community, the type of audience that reads   Gartner    's highly regarded industry research. If only. Gartner isn't   exactly high on MongoDB right now, as the latest ""Magic Quadrant""   for operational database systems puts it well into the   ""challengers"" category rather than the ""leaders"" one. However, it turns out MongoDB didn't actually participate in   this year's Gartner report and Gartner had to rely on ""credible   public sources."" Also, the company had only just announced ACID support for the   4.0 version of MongoDB at the time of Gartner's assessment. It's   reasonable to expect future reports will more closely reflect   Mongo's popularity among database users. (DB-Engines ranks   MongoDB as the world's fifth most popular database and the most   popular NoSQL database for handling unstructured documents and   data.) All of which brings us back to what Ittycheria said in his   comments to CNBC. DocumentDB copies MongoDB for a good reason:   It's worth copying. But for business users, the imitation appears   to be nothing like the original.   10 stocks we like better than MongoDB       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

197,"January 31, 2019, 07:30:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Top Smart-Home Stock to Buy in 2019: Amazon,"
 Smart-home technology promises to make our lives easier. We   can now control our security, lighting, heating, air   conditioning, and entertainment systems remotely via   internet-connected devices, giving us the type of convenience   that was only possible in science fiction movies in years   past. As this technology becomes increasingly affordable, consumer   adoption is poised to grow rapidly. In fact, eMarketer projects   that 74 million people will use a smart speaker this year in the   U.S. alone. Moreover, the global smart-home market will top   $150 billion by 2024, according to Markets and Markets, up from   $77 billion in 2018. Businesses that cater to this surging demand for smart-home   tech could see their sales soar in the coming years -- and one   company stands to profit from this megatrend more than any other.   Read on to learn more about it.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Getty Images.  No discussion of smart-home stocks should fail to include   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) . The e-commerce and cloud computing juggernaut   dominates the smart speaker market with a greater-than-60% share,   according to eMarketer. Amazon's Echo smart speakers are powered by its Alexa voice   assistant technology. Alexa integrates with more than   50,000 ""skills"" (voice-based apps), 20,000 compatible   devices, and 3,500 brand partners. This ever-expanding   ecosystem forms a powerful competitive   moat    around Amazon's smart-home business -- one that will be difficult   for its rivals to penetrate. Hardly one to rest on its laurels, Amazon is pressing its   advantage with   new Alexa-powered devices    and   upgraded software    . By expanding into areas such as home appliances and high-end   audio equipment, the company is attempting to extend its   beachhead further into its customers' homes and daily lives. Just beginning to monetize Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos highlighted the success of the Alexa   voice-assistant in the company's earnings release Thursday. ""Alexa was very busy during her holiday season,"" Bezos   said in a statement. ""Echo Dot was the best-selling item across   all products on Amazon globally, and customers purchased millions   more devices from the Echo family compared to last year."" Yet despite its success, Amazon has only just begun to   monetize Alexa. It sells its Echo devices at near-cost, and it   just recently began to give developers more ways to   promote their products and services    to Alexa users. Amazon has long been willing to sacrifice   short-term profits in order to enter -- and eventually dominate   -- new industries, and it appears to be taking the same approach   with the rapidly growing smart-home market. In fact, Amazon's ultimate strategy may not be to maximize the   profitability of its smart-home devices, but rather use them as a   means to further strengthen its massive e-commerce empire. If   Alexa can increase transactions on Amazon's e-commerce platform   by making it easier to place voice-based orders, its impact could   reach into the tens of billions of dollars. Early signs in this   regard are promising; Echo owners spend about $700 more per   year than the average Amazon customer, according to Consumer   Intelligence Research Partners. Better still, when combined   with device sales and in-app purchases, these Alexa-based   transactions could generate $10 billion in revenue for the   company by 2020, according to RBC Capital Markets. All told, Amazon has built what appears to be an   insurmountable lead in the smart-home arms race. As such, its   stock remains the best way for investors to profit from this   megatrend in the years ahead.

198,"January 31, 2019, 07:04:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,"Buy Facebook (FB) Stock After Q4 Earnings On Instagram, Mobile Ad Strength?","
 Facebook FB  stock closed regular trading Thursday up 10.8% on the back of its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue beat. The question now is should investors think about buying shares of Facebook on the dip while they still can as the social media firm once again proved it is a digital advertising powerhouse?  Quick Q4 Overview  Facebook's quarterly revenues surged 30.4% to reach $16.914 billion, which beat our $16.37 billion Zacks Consensus Estimate. This did mark a slowdown from Q3's 33% top-line expansion, which broke Facebook's streak of 12 straight  quarters of growth rates above 40%. But the law of large numbers eventually makes it hard for firms to post massive year over year gains on a percentage basis, just ask Amazon AMZN  . Meanwhile, the firm's adjusted Q4 earnings skyrocketed 65% to touch $2.38 per share and easily topped our estimate that called for FB's earnings to dip slightly to reach $2.17 a share. On top of that, Facebook's revenues in the U.S. and Canada, which accounts for roughly 50% of total revenues, climbed 32% to $8.43 billion. And European monthly active users jumped 6 million sequentially to close at 381 million, which is a great sign after three straight quarters of sequential drops in the region that accounts for 25% of revenues. Facebook's global MAU total surged 9% from 2.13 billion in the prior-year quarter to reach 2.32 billion. Facebook's less-saturated Asia-Pacific and the ""Rest of World"" markets drove this expansion. Plus, this only marked a small slowdown from Q3's 10% climb, Q2's 11% jump, and Q1's 13% surge.  Outlook  Clearly, it seems like Mark Zuckerberg's firm was able to silence some of its critics that worried the constant negativity would see users leave Facebook. Instead, the company's MAUs continued to hum along at nearly a double-digit pace. In the end, Facebook, like Google GOOGL  , will remain attractive to marketers as non-ad supported streaming platforms like Netflix NFLX  , Amazon, and soon enough Disney DIS  , Apple AAPL  , and AT&T T  make consumers harder and harder to reach. Facebook, which is essentially an advertising company, has seen the importance of its mobile business expand exponentially over the years. In the fourth quarter, mobile advertising revenues represented approximately 93% of its ad business, up from approximately 89% in the year-ago period. This also highlights the growth of FB's photo and video sharing platform Instagram, which is used almost exclusively as a mobile app. Fittingly, Facebook said Wednesday that it will someday soon stop breaking out numbers for its namesake platform and instead report metrics for its ""Family"" of services, which includes WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger. ""We believe these numbers better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using more than one of our services,"" CFO David Wehner said on the firm's   earnings call  . Overall, the company estimated that around 2.7 billion people -or roughly 35% of the world's population-now use Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger every month. Plus 2 billion people use at least one of Facebook's ""Family"" of services every day. The company has placed a great deal of faith and resources in its Stories features, and it seems to be working. Zuckerberg said on the earnings call that Instagram sees 500 million daily active users in its Stories feature alone. Facebook has also poured money into its Craigslist-style Facebook Marketplace as it tries to compete with the likes of eBay EBAY  and others. Maybe more importantly, the company has expanded its longer-form video product for Instagram called IGTV and spent heavily on its dedicated video tab called Facebook Watch, both of which could become even more important in a decentralized, increasingly cable-free world.  Fiscal 2019 & 2020 Estimates   Looking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Facebook's fiscal Q1 revenues to jump 23.49% to reach $14.78 billion. Meanwhile, the company's full-year 2019 revenues are projected to surge 22.22% above 2018's $55.84 billion to reach $68.25 billion. Peeking ahead to 2020, Facebook's revenues are projected to jump 20.93% above our fiscal 2019 projection to reach $82.53 billion. Facebook's earnings outlook doesn't appear as strong in the near term as it spends billions of dollars on cybersecurity, platform cleanups, and growth-based initiatives. With that said,  Facebook stock  closed regular trading Thursday up nearly 11% at $166.69 a share. This still represented over a 24% downturn from its 52-week high of $218.62 per share and could set up a strong buying opportunity for those high on the social media giant that looks poised to remain an advertising and perhaps even an entrainment giant for years to come.

 Amazon (AMZN) came out with quarterly earnings of $6.04 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.55 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.16 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8.83%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online retailer would pos t earnings  of $3.29 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.75, delivering a surprise of 74.77%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. Amazon, which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $72.38 billion for the quarter ended December 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.91%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $60.45 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the   earnings call  . Amazon shares have added about 11.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7%.  What's Next for Amazon?

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power o f earnings  estimate revisions.

202,"January 31, 2019, 05:05:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Here's Why Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Looks Strong After Q2 Earnings,"
 Microsoft MSFT  shares dipped roughly 2% Thursday despite posting solid fiscal second-quarter earnings results after the closing bell Wednesday. The company might have been dinged because its PC sales slipped on the back of an overall production shortage of vital chips from the likes of Intel INTC  . Aside from that, Microsoft appears strong, especially as Apple AAPL  looks to be headed for a rough patch.  Overview  Microsoft surpassed Apple in late 2018 as the world's most valuable company. The firm last held that crown in 2003, driven by the success of Windows. Today, Microsoft has expanded into everything from IoT to cloud computing, while remaining a software and personal computer giant. Microsoft now competes directly against cloud powerhouse Amazon AMZN  with its Azure division. The company has also expanded its search advertising business and the Xbox-driven gaming unit has pushed into the future with its Netflix NFLX  -style Game Pass. Meanwhile, Microsoft acquisitions such as LinkedIn have helped the company immensely. Microsoft's quarterly revenues jumped roughly 12% from the year-ago period to hit $32.471 billion, which inched by our current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $32.45 billion. This matched the year-ago period's 12% top-line expansion and came in below last quarter's 19% climb. At the bottom and of the income statement, MSFT's adjusted quarterly earnings surged 14% to reach $1.10 per share. This marked a sequential slowdown from Q1 fiscal 2019's 36% bottom-line expansion, but came in $0.01 above our estimate.  Details  The firm's Windows OEM (original equipment manufacturer) segment saw its revenue sink by 5%. As we mentioned at the top, some of the downturn was blamed on a shortage of chips. Microsoft's finance chief Amy Hood said in an interview that the limited chip supply ""constrained an otherwise healthy PC ecosystem."" Despite that downturn, Microsoft's More Personal Computing unit popped roughly 7% from the year-ago period to reach $12.993 billion, which did fall just below our $13.086 billion NFM estimate. Once again, the Xbox unit stood out with revenue up 31%. Moving on, MSFT's Intelligent Cloud revenues surged 20% to reach $9.378 billion and come in above our $9.295 billion NFM estimate. This unit was driven by a 76% surge in Azure revenues, which matched last quarter's growth in the division that competes directly against Amazon's AWS. Investors should note that this marked a slowdown from Azure's 98% climb in the year-ago quarter. But this is more likely due to the law of large numbers than a downturn in Microsoft's growing cloud business since overall Intelligent Cloud revenues topped Q2 2018's 15% expansion. Lastly, MSFT's Productivity & Business Processes unit, which includes Office, LinkedIn, and more, jumped over 13% to $10.100 billion, which just beat our $10.096 billion estimate.  Outlook  Looking ahead, the firm's Q3 fiscal 2019 revenues are projected to jump 11.14% to reach $29.81 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. MSFT's current full-year revenues are projected to surge 12.44% to reach $124.09 billion. Peeking even further ahead to fiscal 2020, the tech giant's revenues are expected to climb over 10% above our current year estimate to reach $136.51 billion. Meanwhile, the company's fiscal 2019 earnings are projected to jump 14.43%, while fiscal 2020's EPS figure is expected to climb 11.42% above that. With that said, it seems like Microsoft is poised for double-digit top and bottom-line growth at a time when some tech powers, like Apple, seem influx (also read: What to Expect from Apple in 2019 After Q1 iPhone Revenue Tumbled  ). Let's also not forget that Microsoft is a dividend payer and its stock rested at roughly $104 a share Thursday. This marked over an 11% downturn from its 52-week high and could set up a solid buying opportunity for those high on MSFT.

  Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) turned in another strong quarter to close out   2018, riding a robust holiday season and cloud computing growth,   as the e-commerce giant topped its own guidance and beat analyst   estimates. But Amazon's revenue guidance for the current quarter   fell short of expectations. Revenue jumped 20% to $72.4 billion for the fourth quarter,   coming in at the high end of its guidance range of $66.5 billion   to $72.5 billion, and beating analyst expectations for $71.9   billion. Further down the income statement, operating income   surged year over year from $2.1 billion to $3.8 billion,   surpassing the company's guidance. This is a sign of strength, as   Amazon   shifts toward    more profitable business segments such as advertising, its cloud   computing division Amazon Web Services, and its third-party   marketplace and fulfillment services.

204,"January 31, 2019, 04:28:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,3 Reasons GameStop Failed to Attract Buyers,"
  GameStop    's (NYSE: GME) stock recently sank to its lowest point in   nearly 14 years after the company abandoned its plans to sell   itself. GameStop started exploring a sale last June, with public   equity firm   Apollo Global    (NYSE: APO) and private equity firm Sycamore Partners rumored to   be the top suitors. Let's examine the three main reasons GameStop   couldn't land a buyer, and how these issues could impact its   future. 1. A dying business model GameStop is struggling to counter two relentless headwinds.   First, digital downloads are gradually rendering its sales of new   physical copies of video games -- which generated 35% of its   revenues last quarter -- obsolete.   Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  A lower number of physical games in circulation also throttles   its sales of pre-owned and value video game products, which   accounted for 19% of its revenue last quarters. The gross margins   of both units contracted year-over-year last quarter. Second, most of GameStop's stores are located in malls, which   are struggling to attract customers amid tough competition from   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) and other e-tailers. GameStop partnered   with Amazon in 2017 to pay customers for in-store trade-ins   with Amazon Cash, but that deal didn't meaningfully boost its   pre-owned sales. With over 5,800 brick-and-mortar stores worldwide and a fading   core business, it's likely that GameStop's potential suitors   couldn't figure out how to turn its business around. 2. Murky turnaround plans GameStop's main turnaround strategy is to diversify its stores   beyond video games with gaming accessories (like headsets), pop   culture collectibles, and   even comic books    . That's why it acquired pop culture products retailer ThinkGeek   in 2015. It also started selling digital downloads, and tested   out an in-house game   publishing unit    . GameStop's sales of accessories, collectibles, and digital   downloads all rose by double digits last quarter, but those three   businesses accounted for less than a fifth of its top line. The   long-term growth of all three businesses is also   unpredictable. The recent growth of its accessories business is heavily   dependent on sales of gaming headsets for battle royale titles   like   Fortnite    and   PUBG    , which could gradually lose momentum. The strength of its   collectibles unit relies on robust sales of   Funko    's Pop vinyl figurines, which are widely available at other   retailers. As for digital revenues, GameStop mostly sells   download keys for other DRM platforms -- which Amazon,   Walmart    , and other retailers also offer.   Image source: Getty Images.  GameStop's turnaround strategies seem murky because it still   doesn't have a permanent CEO. Michael Mauler, who only led the   company for three months, abruptly resigned last May for   ""personal reasons."" GameStop recently divested its Spring   Mobile business (which includes about 1,300   AT&T    wireless stores) for over $700 million -- but it's unclear how   much of the cash will be spent on improving its core   business. 3. Unfavorable interest rates GameStop has an   enterprise value    of $2 billion, which includes $471 million in long-term debt that   the buyer would need to pay off. If the buyer can't make an   all-cash purchase, it would need to take on debt to finance the   deal. That's not ideal in a market with rising interest rates.   GameStop highlighted that problem in its press release, stating   that it ""terminated efforts to pursue a sale of the company due   to the lack of available financing on terms that would be   commercially acceptable to a prospective acquirer."" But GameStop's not gone... yet Wall Street expects GameStop's revenue and earnings to fall   12% and 22%, respectively, next year. Those estimates look   bleak, but they're amplified by the divestment of Spring Mobile   -- which should significantly reduce its Technology Brands   revenue (8% of its top line last quarter). Looking ahead, GameStop could use the proceeds from Spring   Mobile to extinguish its debt and continue to improve its   non-gaming businesses. It could also consider cutting its   dividend, which recently was   yielding 10%    , and reinvesting that cash into its e-commerce platforms. The   appointment of a permanent CEO could also give investors a   clearer view of their retailer's long-term future. GameStop is still in trouble, but it trades at just 5 times   forward earnings and its enterprise value is ridiculously low at   0.3 times next year's sales. This means that the stock could   still rally significantly on any notable improvements in its core   businesses.   10 stocks we like better than GameStop       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 (RTTNews.com) - Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN ) Thursday reported a strong increase in profit for the fourth quarter, as revenues for the holiday season quarter jumped 20 percent. Earnings and revenues for the quarter trounced Wall Street estimates. However, the tech giant's outlook for the current quarter was weak.
Seattle, Washington-based Amazon reported fourth-quarter profit of $3.03 billion or $6.04 per share, up from $1.86 billion or $3.75 per share last year. On average, 45 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of $5.67 per share for the quarter.
Amazon's sales for the quarter jumped 20 percent to $72.38 billion from $60.45 billion last year. Analysts had a consensus revenue estimate of $71.87 billion for the quarter.
Sales from North America jumped 18 percent to $44.12 billion from $37.30 billion last year, while international sales rose 15 percent to $20.83 billion. Meanwhile, revenues of Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud service division, surged 45 percent to $7.43 billion.
Looking forward to the first quarter, the company expects sales of $56 billion to $60 billion. Analysts currently estimate revenues of $60.96 billion.
AMZN closed Thursday's trading at $1,718.73, up $48.30 or 2.89%, on the Nasdaq. The stock, however, slipped $3.74 or 0.22% in the after-hours trade.

NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Global equity markets mostly rose on Thursday, fueled by upbeat  Facebook earnings and the Federal Reserve's pledge to be patient in raising borrowing costs further, while U.S. bond yields fell on indications of weaker-than-expected inflation.
The benchmark S&P 500 posted its biggest monthly percentage gain, at 7.89 percent, since October 2015 as U.S. equities continued to surge from their late 2018 swoon. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 9.74 percent in its best month since October 2011.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 15.19 points, or 0.06 percent, to 24,999.67. The S&P 500  gained 23.05 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,704.1 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 98.66 points, or 1.37 percent, to 7,281.74.
U.S. crude prices settled lower as uncertainty about Sino-U.S. trade talks overtook the bullish news about production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, and the Fed's dovish stance.
President Donald Trump said he wanted a ""very big"" trade deal with China, but he signaled there could be delays if talks fail to meet his goals of opening the Chinese economy broadly to U.S. industry and agriculture. 
The Fed's dovish message on monetary policy eased concerns that tighter financial conditions could crimp growth and helped spur stocks along with solid corporate results, such as earnings from Facebook, which topped analysts' estimates. 
Facebook shares rose 10.82 percent.
The Fed's stance was ""stunning"" but Chairman Jerome Powell may be trying to calm the market so that he can hike rates later this year in a classic ""rope-a-dope"" tactic, said Mike Terwilliger, a portfolio manager at Resource America Inc.
Economic data remains weak and a future downturn suggest the Fed should hike rates this year because it won't be able to when the U.S. electoral campaign is in full swing in 2020, he said.
""The need to reload the gun is not going away and the politics suggest he should be as well,"" Terwilliger said.
Amazon.com Inc  forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates, even as sales for the holiday quarter hit a record high, rising 20 percent. Shares of the company fell 1.1 percent to $1,700 in trading after the bell.
MSCI's index of stocks worldwide  rose 0.92 percent and its emerging market index  gained 1.28 percent.
European shares ended a choppy session flat as disappointing economic data, including a technical recession in Italy, sapped an early boost provided by the Fed's dovish tone. 
German retail sales fell at the fastest rate in 11 years, British car production posted its biggest drop since 2009 and euro zone growth was the slowest in four years.
The STOXX 600  ended the day up 0.04 percent but gained 6.1 percent in January, its strongest month since October 2015.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index  of leading European shares closed up 0.23 percent, with oil heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell, BP  and Total  among top gainers.
The dollar index  rose 0.23 percent, with the euro  down 0.28 percent to $1.1445. The Japanese yen  firmed 0.12 percent versus the greenback at 108.92 per dollar.
Treasury yields fell after the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, a measure of regional manufacturing activity, fell to its lowest in two years. 
The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of U.S. labor costs, rose 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter after an unrevised 0.8 percent gain the previous quarter, the Labor Department said.
The data continued a pattern of low inflation. 
""What you've seen the last couple days with the market is the Street's reaction to recognition that cheap money is going to continue for the foreseeable future,"" said Brian Ward, chief executive of Trimont Real Estate Advisors in Atlanta.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note  rose 17/32 in price to push its yield down to 2.6328 percent.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures  fell 44 cents to settle at $53.79 per barrel. Brent crude oil futures  rose 24 cents to settle at $61.89.
U.S. gold futures  settled up 0.7 percent to $1,319.70 an ounce.

Jan 31 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc  on Thursday forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates, warning that new regulations in India had created uncertainty around one of its key growth markets and saying it would step up investments in 2019.
Shares of the company fell 5 percent to $1,635 after the bell.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Net income jumped 63 percent to $3 billion for the fourth quarter, ahead of analysts' estimates.
Yet investors focused their attention on Amazon's international operation, where the company has long lost money in the hopes of future profit. Though its international operating loss shrunk to $642 million in the quarter from $919 million a year earlier, new regulations in India are poised to take a toll. The rules seek to protect local businesses by prohibiting foreign e-commerce companies from selling products via vendors in which they have an equity interest.
Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said on a call with reporters that the ""situation in India is a bit fluid right now.""
The company began removing a wide array of products from its India website late on Thursday to comply with the new foreign investment curbs that kick in on Feb. 1, Reuters reported. 
Still, Olsavsky said, ""India remains a good long-term opportunity.""
Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Baird Equity Research, said, ""The issues in India are taking a toll on the Q1 outlook, even as growth overall slows domestically. Not a bad report, but there are enough questions where (the) stock will likely be under pressure.""


HIGHER SPENDING
The company forecast net sales of between $56 billion and $60 billion for the first quarter, missing analysts' average estimate of $60.77 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The guidance includes two percentage points of negative impact from changes in currency exchange rates.
Olsavsky said that investments would increase this year. The company had little need to splurge in 2018 thanks to prior spending on warehouses, headcount and other areas, boosting profit. But this year investments will rise, though Olsavsky did not detail where or how much.
""As a result, the profit story in ‘19 may not be as good as it was in ‘18,"" said Tom Forte, analyst at D.A. Davidson, adding that this might not be a bad thing.
""If they are stepping on the accelerator, that means they like what they're seeing, and it's worthy of more investment,"" he said.
Amazon forecast operating income will be between $2.3 billion and $3.3 billion this quarter, compared with $1.9 billion a year earlier.
A large chunk of the company's hiring has gone to Amazon Web Services, its lucrative business selling data storage and computing power in the cloud. Revenue for the unit surged 45.3 percent to $7.43 billion, beating an average estimate of $7.26 billion.
Overall, net sales for the fourth quarter were $72.38 billion and beat analysts' average estimate of $71.87 billion on the back of a strong holiday season, which includes the major U.S. shopping event Black Friday.
The results demonstrate that Amazon continued its ""relentless assault"" on other retailers over Christmas, Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.
Amazon said tens of millions of shoppers signed up for its loyalty club Prime during the season - more than in any prior quarter - helping boost revenue from subscription fees 25 percent to $4.0 billion. The company said last year it has more than 100 million Prime members globally.
This expansive customer base has lured merchants to sell goods on the company's marketplace, to the point where more than half of products sold on Amazon come from third-parties.
Making Amazon more profitable still are ad sales. The company now ranks alongside Alphabet Inc'sGoogle and Facebook Inc  as titans in marketing, letting these same merchants pay for high placement in Amazon's search results.
Ad sales and ""other"" revenue jumped 95 percent to $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter.

Amazon sales outlook falls short after record holiday quarter


By Jeffrey Dastin and Arjun Panchadar
Jan 31 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc  on Thursday forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates, warning that new regulations in India had created uncertainty around one of its key growth markets and saying it would step up investments in 2019.
Shares of the company fell 5 percent to $1,635 after the bell.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Net income jumped 63 percent to $3 billion for the fourth quarter, ahead of analysts' estimates.
Yet investors focused their attention on Amazon's international operation, where the company has long lost money in the hopes of future profit. Though its international operating loss shrunk to $642 million in the quarter from $919 million a year earlier, new regulations in India are poised to take a toll. The rules seek to protect local businesses by prohibiting foreign e-commerce companies from selling products via vendors in which they have an equity interest.
Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said on a call with reporters that the ""situation in India is a bit fluid right now.""

230,"January 31, 2019, 09:00:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,"Qualcomm to Add Amazon Music, Video to Your Driving Experience","
  Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) already has an Echo device for your car that will   play music, get you directions, place calls, let you listen to   audiobooks, and even control your smart home while you're behind   the wheel. But do we really need Alexa helping people watch video   while driving? Chipmaker   Qualcomm    (NASDAQ: QCOM)  plans to showcase how its   artificial-intelligence capabilities can enhance the ""in-vehicle   experience"" by allowing drivers the ability to not only call up   Amazon Music and to listen to Audible audiobooks while you're   driving but also make available Amazon Video and Fire TV   programming.   Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  A need for safety first During the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this month,   Qualcomm unveiled its Smart Audio Platform for next-generation   vehicles, to show how vehicles can deliver an interactive   experience for drivers and passengers. Presumably because Qualcomm's senior vice president of product   management, Nakul Duggal, said the chipmaker wanted to   ""continuously improve and expand the realm of possibilities for   in-car experiences while delivering unparalleled safety-conscious   solutions,"" the company suggests that the platform will also   limit the ability of dash-mounted infotainment systems from   activating while the car is in motion. My older   Ford    F-150's infotainment system plays DVDs, for example, but as soon   as you move the gear shift out of park, the video cuts out to   prevent you from driving and watching a movie at the same time.   No doubt Qualcomm's chips offer similar safety features. Drivers   are distracted enough as it is. Bringing AI to the masses The key to Qualcomm's more advanced chips is that they'll   allow more complex systems to be installed in less expensive   cars. There's been some form of voice tech in vehicles since   IBM    introduced voice-controlled navigation into 2005 model year   Hondas    (NYSE: HMC) in 2004, but in low-end models that have thin profit   margins, advanced technologies -- in particular AI capabilities   -- are often hard to come by. The Qualcomm release could be among   the most advanced yet. It kicked off the year by introducing its third-generation   Snapdragon chip for vehicle cockpits that, by dividing them like   its cell-phone chips into entry-level, mid-tier, and high-end   platforms, will give automakers the potential to earn additional   revenue from services even in its base-model cars. Qualcomm told Reuters it has a backlog of design wins with   auto manufacturers totaling $5.5 billion, 10% more than it had   last year. That's an important gain, because it's been battling   both   Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) , which offer Android Auto and CarPlay, to attract   automaker support. These apps, though, are mostly accessed through a smartphone   and supplant a vehicle's native infotainment system, which isn't   necessarily bad, as they're often compatible with other apps that   are better than those that come built-in, such as Waze, WhatsApp,   and   Spotify    . Qualcomm's chips would obviously be the native system. Integrating home and work through your car In Qualcomm's Amazon demo announcement, Amazon's VP of Alexa,   Ned Curic, was quoted as saying that Amazon's ""vision is for   Alexa to be available anywhere customers want to interact with   her, whether they're at home, in the office, or on the go."" The ""on the go"" part is closely linked to two partnerships   Amazon recently signed -- one with   Telenav    , a connected-car and location-based services provider, and the   other with HERE Technologies, a voice-first, in-vehicle   navigation system. Both will allow drivers better navigation   capabilities by having Alexa built into a car's systems from the   start. HERE notes that drivers would be able to plan their routes   while at work or home and that the data would be synced with   their car when they got in. According to Voicebot.ai, 114 million U.S. adults have tried   voice assistants in a car, and 77 million do so monthly,   surpassed only by those who use a smartphone to access one. The   car is a natural place for using voice assistants like Alexa,   since any electronic communications a driver has are supposed to   be hands-free. By expanding it to other capabilities beyond simply   navigation, Qualcomm seeks to usher in the full suite of   Alexa-enabled services and apps and break the need for an   external accessory. It also promises to put voice assistants into   millions of vehicles, which might just help it drive to the   forefront of the industry.   10 stocks we like better than Qualcomm       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Presumably because Qualcomm's senior vice president of product   management, Nakul Duggal, said the chipmaker wanted to   ""continuously improve and expand the realm of possibilities for   in-car experiences while delivering unparalleled safety-conscious   solutions,"" the company suggests that the platform will also   limit the ability of dash-mounted infotainment systems from   activating while the car is in motion.
Bringing AI to the masses The key to Qualcomm's more advanced chips is that they'll   allow more complex systems to be installed in less expensive   cars.
Integrating home and work through your car In Qualcomm's Amazon demo announcement, Amazon's VP of Alexa,   Ned Curic, was quoted as saying that Amazon's ""vision is for   Alexa to be available anywhere customers want to interact with   her, whether they're at home, in the office, or on the go."" The ""on the go"" part is closely linked to two partnerships   Amazon recently signed -- one with   Telenav    , a connected-car and location-based services provider, and the   other with HERE Technologies, a voice-first, in-vehicle   navigation system.
Both will allow drivers better navigation   capabilities by having Alexa built into a car's systems from the   start.

  Microchip Technology Incorporated MCHP  is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Feb 5.  makeArticleAd();  The company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording average positive surprise of 4.13%.    In the las t report  ed quarter, the company delivered non-GAAP earnings of $1.81 per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents. The figure also jumped 28.4% on a year-over-year basis.    The year-over-year upside was driven by higher net sales, which increased 49.5% from the year-ago quarter to $1.513 billion on a non-GAAP basis. The figure comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of$1.512 billion.   Guidance & Estimates    Microchip forecasts third-quarter fiscal 2019 net sales of $1.362-$1.438 billion (mid-point $1.4 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.402 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of almost 41%.    For the fiscal third quarter, non-GAAP earnings are anticipated in the range of $1.49-$1.64 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.57 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.4%.    Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.   Factors to Consider    Strength in Microcontroller Business & Expanding   Portfolio     Microchip's microcontroller business (54.3% of second-quarter sales) continues to outperform the industry and has enabled it to gain significant market share. In the second quarter, segment revenues (GAAP) increased 17% year over year to $778.4 million.    Portfolio expansion across majority of the operating domains bode well. Notably, Microchip is now focusing on improving driving experience to strengthen its position in producing autonomous vehicle controllers.    In fact, the company unveiled cost-effective three-dimensional (3D) gesture recognition controller, MGC3140, which offers a robust single-chip solution for sophisticated automotive HMI designs. The new solution is aimed at reducing driver distractions, in turn enhancing the in-car capability of the drivers.    Robust adoption of company's low power PolarFire solutions is a positive. Recently, Microchip also announced availability of MPLAB X Integrated Development Environment (IDE) version 5.05, that support AVR family of the company's MCUs.    The company added two new devices, ATtiny3217 and ATtiny3216, with highly developed analog features to its tiny AVR MCU series. These are aimed at developing highly responsive sensor nodes.    The new solutions are anticipated to generate incremental revenues, consequently favoring the top line. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for microcontroller revenues is pegged at $737 million for the third quarter.   Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and EPS     Surprise          Microchip Technology Incorporated Price and EPS   Surprise    |      Microchip Technology Incorporated Quote     Acquisitions & Collaborations: Key Growth Drivers     Acquisitions like Microsemi, SMSC, ISSC, Micrel and Atmel have expanded Microchip's product portfolio and continue to aid the top line. Additionally, strong demand for Microsemi's solutions in Data Center, Communications, Defense & Aerospace markets make us optimistic about the company's prospects.    Further, collaborations with the likes of Amazon's AMZN  and Sony SNE  augur well for the company. Notably, the company has collaborated with Amazon Web Services (""AWS"") to support AWS offerings and develop secure cloud systems.    In fact, Microsemi, Microchip's subsidiary recently announced that AcuEdgeZLK38AVS Development Kit for Amazon Alexa Voice Service (""AVS"") could showcase far-field voice pick up and various mic array configurations.    Additionally, Microchip unveiled IS2064GM-0L3, a Bluetooth 5-compliant System-on-Chip (SoC) compatible with Sony's advanced LDAC audio codec technology.    Robust collaborations and strategic buyouts are expected to aid the company in expanding business and total addressable market (TAM), consequently favoring top-line growth.    Other Factors     The company continues to capitalize on enhancing its solution range and improving capacity constraints along with design wins. This provides Microchip a competitive edge in the semiconductor industry.    However, increasing lead time, slim demand trends in ZTE and Bitcoin business domains are headwinds. Further, imposition of tariff owing to trade war between the United States and China has been taking a toll on chipmakers for a while now and remains a concern.

Shutterstock photoAmazon (AMZN) will look to extend what, so far, has been a strong showing for the FAANGs this earnings season, where Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and Netflix (NFLX) have already impressed the Street with strong results.The e-commerce juggernaut, which earlier this month raised already high expectations, is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings after the closing bell on Thursday. The company has boasted that the recent holiday shopping season was the strongest in the company’s history. “Tens of millions of people worldwide” signed up for its Prime service, the company stated. Additionally, more than 1 billion items ordered by Prime members were shipped for free.makeArticleAd();Retail sales in the U.S. from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve rose 5.1% to more than $850 billion, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse. On Thursday, investors will want to know how much of those sales did Amazon capture? In the third quarter, the company spooked investors by issuing Q4 revenue guidance in the range of $66.5 billion and $72.5 billion, well below the consensus estimate of $73.79 billion.For the three months that ended December, the Seattle-based company is expected to earn $5.65 per share on revenue of $71.85 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to $2.16 per share on revenue of $60.45 billion. For the full year, EPS is expected to rise 335% year over year to $19.86 per share, while full-year revenue of $232.37 billion would represent a 30.6% increase year over year.In its last-reported quarter, total revenue grew 29% year over year but fell short of Street estimates. Notably, revenue in North American surged 35% year over year to $34.3 billion, while international revenue grew just 13% to $15.5 billion. Amazon Web Services (AWS) continued to show strong growth, surging not only 46% to $6.7 billion, but posted an over 30% operating margin for the first time.While Prime continues to serve as the key catalyst in strengthening Amazon's presence in the online retail space, AWS remains the breadwinner. Wall Street expects AWS to generate fourth-quarter revenue of $7.2 billion. Assuming AWS grows in a range of 42% to 45% this quarter, that translates to total revenue around $7.3 billion, enough to surpass Street forecast — something Amazon has done the previous four quarters.As such, its revenue performance this quarter will reveal whether concerns about “growth fatigue” is real or perceived. After reaching the $1 trillion-mark last September, Amazon saw its shares drop some 25% during the final three months of 2018. And with the stock still down some 20% from its 52-week high of $2050, I would be a buyer ahead of these results.

235,"January 31, 2019, 08:00:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Another Cloud Computing ETF in the Making,"
 Technological advancement is touching every sphere of life, cloud computing being one such area. This space has been gaining momentum of late. Global X has been trying to make inroads in the space and has filed a new ETF. It is called Global X Cloud Computing ETF. Its ticker code and expense ratio are not decided yet. Per  a source  , spending on cloud computing services is rising faster than anticipated, with software-as-a-service (SaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) deserving a special mention. Capital is being deployed in sectors like government, health care, manufacturing, and retail.  Inside the Proposed Fund  The fund tracks the Indxx Global Cloud Computing Index  . The fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in the securities of the Underlying Index and in American Depositary Receipts and Global Depositary Receipts, based on securities in the Underlying Index. The underlying companies license and deliver mainly ""(i) software over the Internet on a subscription basis (SaaS), (ii) provide a platform for creating software applications which are delivered over the Internet (PaaS), (iii) provide virtualized computing infrastructure over the Internet (IaaS) (iv) own and manage facilities customers use to store data and servers and (v) manufacture or distribute infrastructure and/or hardware components used in cloud  "", per the prospectus.   How Does It Fit in a Portfolio?  Cloud computing is a process in which  data or software is stored outside of a computer  , but can be easily accessed from anywhere at any time via the Internet. This idea is very effective as it helps firms lower IT costs by eliminating the need for servers and also related maintenance costs. Also, it provides greater accessibility. Since everything is on the Internet, users can access any data or document any moment. Needless to say, such advantages will make it a thing of tomorrow. Global investment in cloud services has increased leaps and bounds in recent years as more companies have opted for online infrastructure provided by the likes of Amazon AMZN  , Microsoft MSFT  and Alphabet GOOGL  (read: 4 Tech ETFs to Ride on Oracle's Solid Q2  ). Research firm Gartner expects worldwide public cloud revenues to cross the $278-billion mark in 2021  , up from $145 billion in 2017. Europe's public cloud market is expected to expand 22%  annually until 2022, per International Data Corporation (IDC). This is also helping U.S. cloud service providers as there are not many European players, per an article published on CNBC.  Competition  The fund should not face much competition in this place as there is only one player currently - First Trust Cloud Computing ETF SKYY  .

By Sankalp Phartiyal
MUMBAI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc-owned  Flipkart and Amazon.com Inc's  Indian unit are rushing to rejig ownership structures and rework some key vendor relationships, as they seek to comply with new Indian e-commerce curbs without disrupting their businesses.
In late December, India modified rules around foreign direct investment (FDI) in e-commerce, creating additional hurdles for the retail giants. The rules, which kick in on Friday, do not allow e-commerce sites to ""exercise ownership or control over the inventory"" of sellers. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Traders and rivals say companies such as Amazon and Flipkart have been violating the spirit of these rules by creating proxy sellers or vendors in which they have direct or indirect stakes, allowing firms to give deep discounts that upset off-line trade.
The All India Online Vendors Association, a group of about 3,500 online sellers, has accused both Flipkart and Amazon of using their dominant position to favour selected sellers. Amazon and Flipkart deny the accusations.
Both Amazon and Flipkart sought more time to comply with the new rules. But India said on Thursday, it had, after ""due consideration"" decided not to extend beyond Feb. 1 the deadline for the implementation of the modified FDI norms. 
In a letter to India's industries department earlier this month, Flipkart Chief Executive Kalyan Krishnamurthy said the rules required it to assess ""all elements"" of its business operations, a source told Reuters previously. 
Flipkart and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment on their plans for complying with the new regulations.


EQUITY STAKES
The new rules, meant to close loopholes in the regulations, state that if any seller purchases more than 25 percent of its inventory from the wholesale units or other group companies of an e-commerce firm that runs an online marketplace, then that vendor's inventory will be deemed to be controlled by the e-commerce company.
That could disrupt the models of Amazon and Flipkart, whose wholesale units buy products in bulk and sell to thousands of vendors on their platform, who in turn sell to consumers.
Flipkart was likely to create a so-called ""middle layer"" firm - in which it would have less than a 25 percent shareholding - between its wholesale arm and vendors on its marketplace, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
This company, which would be classified as a non-group company under Indian law, would be able to freely sell to vendors without the 25 percent sourcing restriction, the sources added.
Another rule blocks entities in which an e-commerce firm, or any of its group companies, owns a stake from selling its products on that firm's marketplace.
This creates a barrier for India's Shopper's Stop  to sell on Amazon India, as Amazon's investment arm has a minority stake in the department store chain.
Cloudtail and Appario, among the top sellers on Amazon India, could also face similar restrictions, because Amazon owns minority stakes in their parent firms.
""By the letter of the regulation it will not be considered to be an entity in which Amazon has an equity stake, but if the government is wanting to implement the spirit of this rule they might say this doesn't cut it,"" one of the sources said.
E-commerce players may also be forced to give up the word ""exclusive"" when they launch products such as smartphones on their platforms, as the rules mandate that an online retailer cannot push vendors to ""sell any product exclusively on its platform only"".
Contracts between a brand and e-commerce firms would be reworded to say a brand would not sell to a direct rival, giving it freedom to sell elsewhere, one of the sources said.

By Aditya Kalra and Sankalp Phartiyal
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - E-commerce rules that went into effect in India on Friday caused widespread disruption for Amazon.com, forcing it to take down an array of items from its India website including Echo speakers, batteries and floor cleaners.
Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the products began to disappear from the Amazon India website late on Thursday as it began complying with the revised norms before a midnight deadline.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
In December, India modified foreign direct investment (FDI) rules for its burgeoning e-commerce sector, which has drawn major bets from not only Amazon.com but also the likes of Walmart Inc, which last year bought a majority stake in homegrown e-commerce player Flipkart. 
India's new e-commerce investment rules bar online retailers from selling products via vendors in which they have an equity interest, and also from making deals with sellers to sell exclusively on their platforms.
By Thursday, numerous items sold by vendors such as Cloudtail, in which Amazon holds an indirect equity stake, were no longer available on the Amazon India site.
Clothing from Indian department store chain Shopper's Stop  was also no longer available, as Amazon owns 5 percent of the company.
Amazon's own range of Echo speakers, its Presto-branded home cleaning goods and other Amazon Basics products such as chargers and batteries had also vanished from the website.
Both Amazon and Walmart had lobbied against the latest rules and pushed for a delay in their implementation, but India late on Thursday said the deadline stood.
The situation in India is ""a bit fluid right now,"" but the country remains a good long-term opportunity, Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a conference call with reporters following its fourth-quarter earnings announcement.
The company's main goal is to minimize the impact of the new e-commerce rules on customers and sellers, he added.
Amazon, which saw record sales and profit during the holiday season, has forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates due to the uncertainty in India - one of its key growth markets. 
Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy warned last month that it faces ""significant customer disruption"" if the implementation of the new rules were not delayed. 
On Friday, Flipkart said it was disappointed the government had decided to implement the regulations in haste, adding, however, that it would do everything to be compliant.
""We believe that policy should be created in a consultative, market-driven manner and we will continue to work with the government to promote fair, pro-growth policies,"" Rajneesh Kumar, senior vice president & chief of corporate affairs, said in a statement.


GROWTH DRIVER
The U.S. government has also urged India to protect the investments of the two American retailers, Reuters reported last week. 
Both companies have bet heavily on India being a big growth driver: Amazon has committed to investing $5.5 billion there, while Walmart last year spent $16 billion on Flipkart.
But Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration is seen as keen to appease small traders in the run-up to a general election due by May.
Many small traders say the e-commerce giants use their buying power and control over inventory from affiliated vendors to create an unfair marketplace where they can offer deep discounts on some products.
Such arrangements will be barred under the new policy.
Industry sources have said the new rules will force the big e-sellers to change their business structures, and will raise compliance costs.
Amazon India told Reuters it was ""committed to remaining compliant to all the laws of the land"", adding that all sellers make their own independent decisions of what to list and when.
Exclusive deals with sellers will be discontinued, the two sources said.

Amazon pulls numerous products from India website as new e-commerce rules bite


By Aditya Kalra and Sankalp Phartiyal
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - E-commerce rules that went into effect in India on Friday caused widespread disruption for Amazon.com, forcing it to take down an array of items from its India website including Echo speakers, batteries and floor cleaners.
Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the products began to disappear from the Amazon India website late on Thursday as it began complying with the revised norms before a midnight deadline.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
In December, India modified foreign direct investment (FDI) rules for its burgeoning e-commerce sector, which has drawn major bets from not only Amazon.com but also the likes of Walmart Inc, which last year bought a majority stake in homegrown e-commerce player Flipkart. 
India's new e-commerce investment rules bar online retailers from selling products via vendors in which they have an equity interest, and also from making deals with sellers to sell exclusively on their platforms.
By Thursday, numerous items sold by vendors such as Cloudtail, in which Amazon holds an indirect equity stake, were no longer available on the Amazon India site.
Clothing from Indian department store chain Shopper's Stop  was also no longer available, as Amazon owns 5 percent of the company.
Amazon's own range of Echo speakers, its Presto-branded home cleaning goods and other Amazon Basics products such as chargers and batteries had also vanished from the website.
Both Amazon and Walmart had lobbied against the latest rules and pushed for a delay in their implementation, but India late on Thursday said the deadline stood.
The situation in India is ""a bit fluid right now,"" but the country remains a good long-term opportunity, Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a conference call with reporters following its fourth-quarter earnings announcement.
The company's main goal is to minimize the impact of the new e-commerce rules on customers and sellers, he added.
Amazon, which saw record sales and profit during the holiday season, has forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates due to the uncertainty in India - one of its key growth markets. 
Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy warned last month that it faces ""significant customer disruption"" if the implementation of the new rules were not delayed. 
On Friday, Flipkart said it was disappointed the government had decided to implement the regulations in haste, adding, however, that it would do everything to be compliant.
""We believe that policy should be created in a consultative, market-driven manner and we will continue to work with the government to promote fair, pro-growth policies,"" Rajneesh Kumar, senior vice president & chief of corporate affairs, said in a statement.


GROWTH DRIVER
The U.S. government has also urged India to protect the investments of the two American retailers, Reuters reported last week. 
Both companies have bet heavily on India being a big growth driver: Amazon has committed to investing $5.5 billion there, while Walmart last year spent $16 billion on Flipkart.
But Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration is seen as keen to appease small traders in the run-up to a general election due by May.
Many small traders say the e-commerce giants use their buying power and control over inventory from affiliated vendors to create an unfair marketplace where they can offer deep discounts on some products.
Such arrangements will be barred under the new policy.
Industry sources have said the new rules will force the big e-sellers to change their business structures, and will raise compliance costs.
Amazon India told Reuters it was ""committed to remaining compliant to all the laws of the land"", adding that all sellers make their own independent decisions of what to list and when.
Exclusive deals with sellers will be discontinued, the two sources said.
It is unclear how long the disruption will last. Would-be buyers of Echo speakers on Amazon India saw a message reading: ""We don't know when or if this item will be back in stock.""

Jan 31 (Reuters) - Charter Communications Inc topped quarterly revenue  estimates on Thursday, as the cable operator attracted more customers for its internet services, offsetting a drop in video subscribers.
More and more subscribers are deserting pay TV bundles and switching to cheaper streaming services such as Netflix  and Amazon.com's Prime video.
That has pushed companies including Charter and Comcast Corp  to focus on their broadband businesses and high-speed internet upgrades as a strategy to survive in the rapidly changing media landscape.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
The company reported a loss of 36,000 residential video customers in the quarter, compared with net 2,000 customers it gained last year.
Net income attributable to shareholders fell to $296 million, or $1.29 per share, from $9.55 billion, or $34.56 per share, a year earlier, when the company booked a huge tax benefit.
Total revenue rose 5.9 percent to $11.23 billion. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $11.14 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

246,"January 30, 2019, 09:17:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,2 Big Risks MercadoLibre Investors Shouldn’t Ignore,"
 At first glance, there is a ton to like about shares of   MercadoLibe    (NASDAQ: MELI) . Founded in 1999 in Argentina, MercadoLibre has   expanded its e-commerce platform across 19 countries in Latin   America and dominates e-commerce in the region. Even better, it   operates in a region of over 600 million people, where   internet penetration is still low but growing faster than in more   developed regions. That's allowed MercadoLibre to put up some   impressive growth numbers    . Last quarter the company grew its confirmed registered users by   24%, and grew revenue (on a currency-neutral basis) by   58%. There are often just a few e-commerce leaders in any   specific country due to the   network effects    of attracting more buyers and sellers in a virtuous cycle, so   MercadoLibre's first-mover status is a big advantage. MercadoLibre has also succeeded in rolling out its own   payments platform called Mercado Pago. The payments platform was   developed to help customers pay for goods on MercadoLibre's   marketplaces, but has now extended to offline services in a big   way. In September, Mercado Pago processed more transactions   offline than it did on MercadoLibre's marketplaces for the first   time. MercadoLibre also developed a point-of-sale solution   (mPOS) for merchants to complement Mercado Pago, with an aim to   make Pago use a daily habit.makeArticleAd(); With so much going for it, why would I be hesitant to invest?   Well, there are a few key risks investors should consider before   investing in MercadoLibre shares.   Image source: Getty Images.  Currency and political volatility Remember how I mentioned a ""currency-neutral"" revenue growth   rate of 58%? MercadoLibre operates in countries whose economies   and political situations are much more volatile than the U.S.   Despite 58% revenue growth in local currencies, the company's   dollar-denominated revenue growth was only 17% last quarter --   quite a difference. While a majority of MercadoLibre's costs are also in these   local currencies, ultimately it's still an issue -- making the   same margin on a lower dollar amount will ultimately make a   business worth less to U.S. investors. In the last year, the   Argentine peso depreciated by roughly 50% against the   strengthening U.S. dollar. That could reverse and lead to big   gains, but could also continue to go the other way. The currency wildcard goes hand in hand with political   instability. Late in 2017, the company had to exit its Venezuela   operations after the country defaulted on its government bonds.   MercadoLibre deconsolidated the Venezuelan segment, and wrote   down $85.8 million in assets after the default. While Venezuela seems like an outlier case in terms of its   severity, political and financial instability have the potential   to wreak havoc on MercadoLibre's results (through no fault of the   company). Amazon is a laggard, but taking aim In addition to macro uncertainty, MercadoLibre investors also   need to consider the looming specter of   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) , which has had its sights set on Brazil since   2012, when it began to sell books in the country. Brazil has 200   million people, and is the world's eighth-largest economy, making   it a big enough market for Amazon to target. Brazil also happens to be far and away MercadoLibre's biggest   market, making up 62% of the company's revenue last quarter. Now, this isn't reason for panic, as MercadoLibre is far and   away the leader in Brazil, with the largest network of buyers and   sellers. Despite its efforts, Amazon hasn't made much headway as   of yet, as Brazil's infrastructure problems and byzantine tax   structure make it difficult for foreign competitors to get a leg   up on the locals. According to the    New York Times     , Amazon made up just 1% of Brazil's e-commerce market last year,   despite having been in the country for six years -- compared to   MercadoLibre's 19% market share. Still, that's not stopping Amazon from continuing to push into   Brazil. Amazon has reportedly leased a massive warehouse outside   of Sao Paulo, and hired a lot of workers in Brazil in 2018. While   Amazon is far behind now, the relatively fragmented market in   Brazil (with the leader only having 19% market share) means the   threat likely hasn't passed. And even though Amazon hasn't made headway, it's still having   an effect on MercadoLibre: Last year, MercadoLibre began offering   free shipping to pre-empt Amazon's push. That wound up being   a huge hit to the company's profitability    . Eyes wide open MercadoLibre shareholders shouldn't just look at the company's   eye-popping growth numbers in local currency, but should realize   they are investing in emerging markets.

MercadoLibre operates in countries whose economies   and political situations are much more volatile than the U.S.
While a majority of MercadoLibre's costs are also in these   local currencies, ultimately it's still an issue -- making the   same margin on a lower dollar amount will ultimately make a   business worth less to U.S. investors.
Amazon is a laggard, but taking aim In addition to macro uncertainty, MercadoLibre investors also   need to consider the looming specter of   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) , which has had its sights set on Brazil since   2012, when it began to sell books in the country.
Brazil also happens to be far and away MercadoLibre's biggest   market, making up 62% of the company's revenue last quarter.
According to the    New York Times     , Amazon made up just 1% of Brazil's e-commerce market last year,   despite having been in the country for six years -- compared to   MercadoLibre's 19% market share.
Eyes wide open MercadoLibre shareholders shouldn't just look at the company's   eye-popping growth numbers in local currency, but should realize   they are investing in emerging markets.
At the same time, the   looming threat of Amazon, even in the background, needs to be   monitored, as it may put a ceiling on MercadoLibre's ultimate   profitability.

247,"January 30, 2019, 08:51:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,What to Expect from Apple (AAPL) in 2019 After Q1 iPhone Revenue Tumbled,"
 Shares of Apple AAPL  surged nearly 7% Wednesday one day after the company reported a 15% downturn in quarterly iPhone revenue. Apple did top earnings estimates and its stock is still down roughly 30% from its 52-week high, which might explain the positivity. But let's see what investors should expect from Apple in the rest of 2019 and beyond amid a slowing Chinese economy and an increasingly saturated iPhone market.   Quick Q1 Overview  Apple's quarterly revenues dipped 4.5% from the year-ago period to reach $84.310 billion and its adjusted Q1 earnings climbed 7.5%, both of which topped our Zacks Consensus Estimates. However, the company's overall net income slipped slightly and its quarterly estimates had already fallen in a big way after CEO Tim Cook lowered the firm's quarterly revenue guidance in early January. On top of its holiday-quarter sales decline, Apple's iPhone revenues plummeted 15% from $61.104 billion in Q1 2018 to $51.982 billion. This marked a massive downturn from Q4's 29% iPhone revenue growth. Meanwhile, Apple's sales in Greater China tumbled 27% from $17.956 billion to $13.169 billion. Apple's revenues in the region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan and accounts for roughly 20% of total AAPL sales, climbed 16% in Q4 and 11% in the prior-year quarter.  Outlook  Apple obviously faced macroeconomic factors that were out its control, which also impacted everyone from Intel INTC  to Alibaba BABA  . It is unclear how China's economy will perform down the road, especially as the trade war between the U.S. continues. This likely means Apple will find it even harder to grow its market share against Huawei, Xiaomi, and other more affordable smartphone options in the world's second-largest economy. On top of that, Apple, as it did in its just-reported quarter, will have to compare its iPhone revenues against quarters that already featured its newer, high priced smartphones. For instance, Q4 2018 iPhone revenues climbed nearly 30% despite flat unit growth. Let's also not forget that Apple seemed to signal last quarter that iPhone unit growth will likely remain flat or fall for years to come when it said it would stop breaking down unit sales. Of course, Apple was a strong company long before the iPhone, but the smartphone did turn it into the behemoth it is today. Apple could roll out another game-changing product in the future. And let's not forget that Apple's services revenue did pop 19% in Q1 to reach $10.9 billion Apple might also soon enough start to challenge Netflix NFLX  , Amazon AMZN  , and Disney DIS  with its own streaming TV offering. Recen t report  s even said that Apple is ready to expand its gaming division, similar to Microsoft MSFT  . Furthermore, Cook is confident that its Apple Watch-style health offerings will play a vital role going forward.       2019 and 2020 Estimates  At the moment, our Zacks Conesus Estimate calls for Apple's second-quarter revenues to slip 2.48% to reach $59.62 billion. But this could change as more analysts update their estimates after Apple said Tuesday that it expects to report revenue between $55 billion and $59 billion in Q2 2019. Meanwhile, Apple's adjusted Q2 earnings are projected to slip 2.20%. Apple's full-year fiscal 2019 revenues are also projected to dip 2.44%. Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, our estimate calls for the tech power's revenues to pop 2.76% above our current 2019 estimate.  Apple stock  closed regular trading Wednesday up 6.83% at $165.25 a share. This still marked a roughly 30% downturn from its 52-week high of $233.47 per share and might set up a buying opportunity for those high on a firm that does pay a dividend and returns value to shareholders through stock buybacks. But it does seem that Apple is poised to face a slowdown in 2019 as it tries to navigate a potential crossroads.

248,"January 30, 2019, 07:41:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Here's Why Netflix's Subscriber Count Is Soaring,"
 When   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) reported its   fourth-quarter results    , the company's subscriber growth continued its steady march   upward. Global paying customers increased 26% year over year to   more than 139 million. The addition of 8.84 million   subscribers during the quarter far exceeded the 7.6 million   Netflix had previously anticipated. The streaming giant continues to confound skeptics by   bypassing even its own ambitious forecasts. But what's driving   the rapid subscriber additions? Netflix has long known it's all about the content. Since its   inception, the company has used the massive amount of data it has   collected from viewers to determine how much to spend for its   licensed programming, what genres to invest in, and what original   programs would appeal to the widest audience. New research shows   that this continues to be an unsung advantage for the streaming   giant.makeArticleAd();   Outside Netflix headquarters in Los Gatos, California. Image     source: Netflix.  Certified fresh Analysis by independent news site      Streaming Observer    , which focuses on cord-cutting and streaming television, shows   that Netflix has more movies that viewers want to watch than any   other streaming service. The research used data from review   aggregation site   Rotten   Tomatoes    to compare the popularity of the movies found on the top four   streaming platforms: Netflix,   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN)  Prime Video, Hulu, and   AT&T'    s (NYSE: T) HBO Now. A movie is deemed ""Certified Fresh"" by   Rotten Tomatoes if it maintains a rating of 75% or higher after   accumulating 80 reviews for a wide release, or 40 reviews   for a limited release. Streaming Observer   found    that Netflix had 596 Certified Fresh movies in its catalog, more   than Hulu, Amazon Prime, and HBO Now combined. Amazon was found   to have the greatest selection of films with 17,461, followed by   Netflix (3,839), Hulu (2,336), and HBO Now (815). Netflix wins out when it comes to quality, however. Among the   films available for streaming on Netflix, 15.5% were Certified   Fresh, compared with 9.6% for Hulu, 4.7% for HBO Now, and just   1.3% for Amazon Prime. While this is just one measure, it does illustrate the growing   quality of Netflix's library of content, which is, in turn,   attracting new subscribers.   Netflix has more ""Certified Fresh"" movies than its top three     competitors combined. Chart used with permission. Chart source:     Streaming Observer      .  It's all about the data One of the most underappreciated aspects of Netflix's business   model continues to be the company's use of the information it   gathers from viewers. This applies not only to the programs it   streams, but also to how much the company will spend on a   specific piece of licensed content. That's not all. When Netflix was negotiating last year to   poach award-winning producer, director, and writer Ryan Murphy   from   Twenty-First Century Fox    (NASDAQ: FOX) (NASDAQ: FOXA) , the company used data to help   seal the deal    . Murphy is best known for his hit shows   Glee    ,   American Horror Story    ,   Nip/Tuck    ,   9-1-1    ,   Feud    , and   American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson    . Netflix shared a host of information with Murphy about how   his shows performed with audiences on the platform, as well as   what other programs his viewers found appealing. This is just one of many examples of how Netflix has mined the   data that it has from viewers going all the way back to its   DVD-by-mail days. The birth of streaming more than a decade ago   ratcheted up the level of granular data that Netflix has on its   customers. The company knows what its viewers watch, for how   long, when they pause, and if they quit watching a program. One of the most famous examples of Netflix's use of data was   in its decision to green-light   House of Cards    , its first hit original series. The company had statistics that   showed a preference for the work of director David Fincher and   actor Kevin Spacey, as well as an affinity among its subscribers   for the original British version of   House of Cards    . The intersection of these three data points told Netflix the   show would be a hit. Shortly after its release, the company   revealed that the series had become its most-streamed program in   dozens of countries around the world. A hedge against the competition Many Netflix detractors are quick to point out the growing   competition in the streaming sector, and big players like   Disney    (NYSE: DIS) and   Apple     getting into the game. Disney already has a 30% stake in   Hulu, which will soon grow to 60% once its   acquisition of Fox is complete    . Hulu's   recent pricing decision    seemed to be aimed directly at Netflix. Apple, meanwhile, is   reportedly   planning to debut a streaming service    , which may launch as early as this year. While both companies are worthy adversaries and neither can be   discounted, Netflix has an ongoing advantage that the competition   can't match -- a more than 20-year head start collecting data   from its subscribers. This trove of information and Netflix's   algorithms help the company make a host of better decisions. The   biggest benefit of all this data is knowing precisely what   programs viewers want to watch -- exactly why Netflix subscriber   growth is soaring.   10 stocks we like better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

249,"January 30, 2019, 07:04:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,"What to Expect from Amazon (AMZN) Q4 Earnings, Revenue, AWS & More","
 Amazon AMZN  saw its stock price jump nearly 5% during regular trading hours Wednesday, just one day before it is set to release its fourth-quarter earnings. The question is does this climb mean investors expect big things from Amazon's Q4 financial results, or did it simply get a boost from Apple AAPL  , Alibaba BABA  , Boeing BA  , and other giants who climbed following their quarterly earnings releases?  Top & Bottom Line Outlook  Amazon, unlike Apple, Alibaba, and others, doesn't have as much exposure to the slowing Chinese economy. Still, Amazon is coming off a third-quarter that saw its revenues slow, which led to AMZN's significant decline in the last quarter of 2018. In fact, Amazon's third-quarter revenues climbed only 29%, compared to Q2's 39% surge, Q1's 43% climb, and Q4 2017's 38% jump. With that said, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Amazon's Q4 revenues to climb 18.65% from the year-ago period to reach $71.73 billion. Cleary, the fourth quarter looks as though it is set to be the e-commerce giant's slowest in some time. Meanwhile, Amazon's adjusted Q4 earnings are projected to soar 156.94%. Plus, AMZN has earned some positive earnings estimate revisions over the last 30 days, which means at least some analyst are higher on Amazon's bottom line than they were not too long ago. Amazon's earnings might become more important going forward as the company's size makes massive year over year revenue growth harder to achieve. Investors also need to know what to expect from some of Amazon's most important businesses Thursday because they could determine how AMZN stock trades, especially in the near-term.  Amazon Web Services  AMZN's cloud computing business will remain a closely watched division on Wall Street. Our current NFM estimate calls for Amazon's AWS revenues to jump 43% from $5.113 billion in the year-ago period to reach $7.306 billion. Last quarter, AWS revenues climbed 46% and they surged 44% in the year-ago period. So clearly, this would fall in line with AWS' performance in recent periods. Plus, Amazon captured 35% of the cloud infrastructure services market last quarter, to destroy second-place Microsoft's MSFT  15% share, as well as IBM IBM  and Google GOOGL  .  Subscriptions  Investors will also want to pay close attention to Amazon's subscription services segment. This unit's revenues, which include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships, audiobook, digital video, e-book, digital music, and other non-AWS subscription services, are projected to surge 35% to reach $4.283 billion. Our NFM projection would mark a slowdown from Q3's 52% climb and Q4 2017's 47% jump. Amazon's subscription business not only helps its core e-commerce business grow because of the shipping deals, but it will also become more important as it tries to challenge Netflix NFLX  and soon enough Disney DIS  , AT&T T  , and others in the quickly growing streaming entertainment market.  Advertising  Lastly, we are going to check in on Amazon's ""other"" revenue segment. This unit is primarily made up of Amazon's growing advertising business, which hopes to take more market share from Facebook (FB) and Google for years to come. This segment's revenues skyrocketed 122% last quarter and 129% in Q2, and are projected to surge over 97% in the fourth quarter to reach $3.425 billion.  Bottom Line  Amazon is a currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) based on its recent positive earnings estimate revision activity. AMZN stock popped 4.80% during regular trading Wednesday to hit $1,670.43 a share, which marked an 18.5% downturn from its 52-week high. Despite its projected top-line slowdown, which might delight the likes of Walmart WMT  and Target TGT  , Wall Street will be watching closely when Jeff Bezos' company reports its Q4 2018 financial after the closing bell Thursday.

250,"January 30, 2019, 07:00:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,"Amazon Is Expanding Whole Foods, Prime Now into the Suburbs","
  Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) intends to leverage Whole Foods Market to drive   new growth in its Prime member loyalty program. Believing it has   blunted its ""Whole Paycheck"" image    , the organic grocer will be expanding into the suburbs with more   stores offering Prime Now delivery. Because the grocery wars are intensifying, with more rivals   cutting prices, Amazon is consolidating its grocery message   around the formats where it thinks it can win.   Image source: Whole Foods Market.makeArticleAd();  Winnowing the field Previously, Amazon offered several ways for the grocery store   shopper to buy from it. The company delivered nonperishable food   items and household supplies through its Prime Pantry service. It   also delivered fresh groceries through AmazonFresh. It also   operated Whole Foods Market grocery stores, Whole Foods 365   discount stores, Amazon Go convenience stores, and Whole Foods   grocery delivery through Instacart and Prime Now. In the past month, however, Amazon ended its relationship with   Instacart and announced the Whole Foods 365 chain won't expand to   new markets as previously planned. The signs are there that we   will see more changes in the near future. Already a competitive business, other supermarket chains are   throwing elbows to gain an advantage:  Aldi is spending over $5 billion to remodel its existing     1,800-store chain and open 800 new ones to become the     third-largest grocer behind     Walmart      and     Kroger.  Lidl, whose prices tend to be even lower than     Aldi's, is also expanding, though primarily on the East     Coast and not at the same rate as Aldi. Weis Markets, a mid-Atlantic chain, announced price cuts on     some 7,000 products. Kroger previously said it was cutting prices in its     Roundy's chain to compete with Amazon and Aldi. The pioneer of online grocery stores, Peapod, cut prices on     thousands of products last year. Walmart -- which offers delivery from more than 800 of its     stores and plans to add 800 more in 2019 -- added four more     companies to expand its online grocery-delivery options.  This comes as Amazon is feeling the effects of slowing online   grocery sales, with growth tumbling 25% in 2018 from the prior   year. According to an analysis by ecommerce consultant group Edge   by Ascential, ""After spending years investing in subpar programs   like Amazon Fresh and Prime Pantry, consumers still aren't sold   on buying fresh food online."" The analysis suggested this was a   major reason Amazon bought Whole Foods in 2017. A prime reason to change Prime growth has also   stagnated in the U.S.    , which would explain why Amazon now wants to expand its grocery   delivery options into the suburbs and give more rural customers a   chance to take advantage of two-hour delivery through Prime   Now. Amazon continues to increase its benefits offerings to Prime   subscribers. Adding the ability to shop at Whole Foods for people   living where the chain is currently unavailable might be a way to   boost Prime membership. And because Whole Foods has had a   reputation in the past for being associated with more affluent   communities in larger metro areas, expanding to more rural   markets could be considered a big change in direction for the   grocer. Even so, questions linger about whether Whole Foods has really   broken with its upscale image. Surveys show sizable chunks of the   public still believe its prices are too high. A Yahoo!   Finance survey last August found 40% of the 2,000 people polled   believe Whole Foods prices have not noticeably fallen. Because Prime Now is only available in some 60 U.S. cities,   the expansion of Whole Foods into more markets (and the grocery   delivery service that would come with it) might herald an   accelerated expansion of grocery delivery to underserved regions   of the U.S. It could also indicate Amazon.com's other flagging   grocery delivery options may be in line for a major shake-up that   includes some consolidation.

251,"January 30, 2019, 06:40:40 PM EDT",AMZN,Trefis,What To Watch For In Alibaba’s Q3 Earnings,"
 Alibaba  ( BABA  ) reports its Q3 on January 30. The company's stock had fallen on the back of a 4-6% reduction in management's guided revenue range for fiscal 2019. We expect the company to have some positive commentary around the outlook for 2019 on the back of the stimulus package that the Chinese government is rolling out. It will also be interesting to gain some more information surrounding Jack Ma's new role at the company. We currently have a price estimate of $173 per share  for Alibaba, which is around 15% higher than the current market price. Our interactive dashboard on  Alibaba's Price Estimate   outlines our forecasts and estimates for the company. You can modify any of the key drivers to visualize the impact of changes on its valuation.   makeArticleAd(); Owing to an economic slowdown in China and the ongoing trade disagreements between the U.S. and China, Alibaba has already indicated its expectations of a lower growth. However, on the back of expected stimulus packages to the tune of $200 billion from the Chinese government, we will be listening for management's expectations of acceleration in retail growth on the back of tax cuts and other factors. Another key area of focus will be how the stock reacts to Jack Ma's thoughts and role at the company. Last year in September, after Alibaba's co-founder and executive chairman announced his decision to retire, the stock fell nearly 20% from the date of the announcement on September 7 to around $130 at the end of October, though it has rebounded since then. While part of the fall can be attributed to the broader market correction, Ma's decision to pursue philanthropy in education also likely contributed significantly. Ma was previously an English teacher and will continue to be on Alibaba's board, while holding a 6%-plus stake in the company. Despite the relatively minor stake, Ma may have a lot more control in the company due to its complex legal structure.  Do not agree with our forecast?

252,"January 30, 2019, 06:40:31 PM EDT",AMZN,Trefis,What To Expect From Amazon’s Q4 Earnings,"
Amazon's ( AMZN  ) Q4 earnings release on January 31 will be eagerly watched to understand the company's standing in international markets, as well as the performance in the cloud market in the context of claims made by Oracle. We expect Amazon to continue growing profitable across all segments, except the International business due to competitive pressures. We currently have a price estimate of $1,600 per share  for Amazon, which is about in line with the current market price. Our interactive dashboard on  Amazon's Price Estimate    outlines our forecasts and estimates for the company. You can modify any of the key drivers to visualize the impact of changes on its valuation.   makeArticleAd(); During its analyst day in October last year, Oracle made some major claims about the value proposition and consequent traction of Oracle's cloud versus AWS. While Amazon's management may not directly respond to specific competitive questions, the company's view on traction and its growth outlook is likely to shed some light on market developments. Additionally, with the IBM and Red Hat deal, Amazon's position in the hybrid cloud market will be another area of interest. On the retail side, Amazon's performance in the U.S. in the backdrop of rising interest rates (especially during the holiday season) could point towards the larger trend of U.S. growth. While internationally, Europe is likely to be stable, India should be a hot topic due to the country's recent rulings which earlier had barred private label goods only to be reversed within a week. Also, competition from Flipkart (owned by Walmart) is likely to have dented margins. Entering 2019, while Amazon may have some good news on its devices business, the plan for the bigger businesses will be the key for the stock price.  Do not agree with our forecast?

253,"January 30, 2019, 04:48:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Alibaba Revenue Slows: What's Next for BABA Stock Amid China's Downturn?,"
 Shares of Alibaba BABA  surged over 6% Wednesday despite posting its slowest quarterly revenue growth in three years before the opening bell. The Chinese e-commerce powerhouse did see some impressive overall growth and Alibaba executives tried to calm investor nerves about the economic slowdown in China.  Overview  Alibaba's quarterly revenues surged 41% from the year-ago period to 117.28 billion yuan or $17.5 billion. The company's core commerce unit saw its sales soar 40% to $14.958 billion to account for roughly 85% of BABA's total quarterly revenues. On its face, this top-line growth appears impressive, but it marked Alibaba's slowest pace  since the January through March quarter of 2016. With that said, Alibaba's revenues surge 54% last quarter, 61% in the June quarter, and 56% in the December period of last year. The e-commerce firm also warned investors of a slowdown in November when it cut its full-year revenue forecast. Plus, we now know that China's economy last year expanded at its slowest pace since 1990 as the trade war with the U.S. continues (also read: Breaking Down Apple's Dismal Q1 iPhone & Greater China Revenues  ). Investors were likely pleased that Alibaba was able to top quarterly net income and adjusted earnings estimates. This bottom-line beat came as even more of a surprise after at least 20 companies  in China warned investors Tuesday that full-year earnings would fall below expectations. Part of its bottom-line growth was attributed to an accounting gain based on the revaluation of a subsidiary.       Outlook  Alibaba runs China's two largest e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall. But Alibaba, like Amazon AMZN  , has focused on expansion into new growth areas that could help the firm amid a slowing Chinese economy. The firm's cloud computing revenues skyrocketed 84% to $962 million. Meanwhile, BABA's digital media and entertainment sales surged 20% to reach $944 million. This unit could become hugely important in the age of Netflix NFLX  as everyone from Disney DIS  to AT&T T  races to expand its streaming business. Maybe more importantly, Alibaba added 35 million annual active consumers on its retail marketplaces in China during the quarter to close with 636 million. Plus, the firm's mobile monthly active users reached 699 million in December 2018, up 33 million above September 2018. CEO Daniel Zhang said on the company's   earnings call  that the economic slowdown in China ""might cause concerns in the market. However, what we see from Alibaba's platforms is that Chinese consumption growth is still strong,"" Going forward, spending on big-ticket items will likely continue to decline in China, according to analysts. But Alibaba said that it has seen sustained demand for home furnishings, apparel, cosmetics, and other faster-moving consumer goods. The company has also expanded into overseas markets, bricks-and-mortar retail, and food-delivery, which includes working with the likes of Starbucks SBUX  . Looking ahead to the following fiscal year, Alibaba's revenues are projected to climb 35.46% above our current year Zacks Consensus Estimate to reach $74.69 billion. At the bottom end of the income statement, BABA's adjusted full-year earnings are expected to surge 23.60%.  Bottom Line  Alibaba is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based on its recen t earnings  estimate revision activity. Meanwhile, BA BA stock  rested up roughly 6% through late afternoon trading Wednesday at $166.54 a share. This marked a roughly 21% downturn from its 52-week high of $211.70 per share. Therefore, Alibaba has plenty of room to run despite its post-earnings climb. And with giants like Facebook FB  , Apple AAPL  , and even Amazon set to see their growth slow, BABA stock might become more attractive.

By Vibhuti Sharma and Jeffrey Dastin
Jan 30 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp  on Thursday met Wall Street's targets for its quarterly results and forecast, though Azure cloud computing sales grew more slowly than a year earlier.
Shares of Microsoft, one of the most valuable U.S. technology companies, fell 3 percent in extended trade even though earnings per share slightly beat analysts' estimates. The stock had closed 3.3 percent higher in a broad tech rally.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Long known for its Windows software, Microsoft has shifted its focus to the fledgling cloud market where it is battling Amazon.com Inc  for dominance.
The company is rapidly picking up business from the retail industry in particular, which is aiming to keep pace with the e-commerce business of Amazon. This month alone, Microsoft announced deals with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc  and Kroger Co, on top of a five-year agreement with Walmart Inc  it unveiled this summer. 
""Our strong commercial cloud results reflect our deep and growing partnerships with leading companies in every industry including retail, financial services, and healthcare,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in a statement.
But Wall Street has grown accustomed to blockbuster earnings beats as companies around the globe ditch their own data centers for the cloud.
""It wasn't a blowout quarter,"" said analyst Shannon Cross of Cross Research. ""That's probably playing a bit into"" the stock decline.
Microsoft forecast revenue of between $29.4 billion and $30.1 billion in the current quarter. Analysts were expecting  $29.9 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
The company also said a stronger U.S. dollar would hit growth of its intelligent cloud business segment, which includes Azure and other products, by 2 percentage points.
Microsoft has long courted customers outside the United States and has a 17 percent share of the global cloud market, research firm Canalys previously said. Amazon has 32 percent.
Microsoft is spending more on the latest cloud technologies to narrow the gap. Research and development expenses rose to $4.1 billion in the quarter from $3.5 billion a year earlier.
""Clearly the company is spending aggressively to double down on its cloud bet, a dynamic that is a smart move but caps margin upside in the quarter,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.
Microsoft's total revenue climbed 12.3 percent to $32.47 billion. Wall Street analysts on average had expected revenue of $32.51 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Revenue from Microsoft's productivity software unit climbed 13 percent to $10.1 billion, powered by double-digit revenue growth for LinkedIn and Office 365. Wall Street analysts on average had expected revenue of $10.09 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Microsoft's personal computing division, home to Windows software and still its largest by revenue, showed revenue growth of 7 percent to $13 billion, while analysts had expected $13.07 billion. The unit also includes Xbox gaming consoles, the Bing online search service and Surface laptops.
Microsoft reported a profit of $8.42 billion. Excluding one-time items, it earned $1.10 per share, edging past analysts' estimates of $1.09 per share.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft MSFT  , Amazon AMZN  and Netflix NFLX  .   Microsoft (MSFT) Q2 Earnings Preview: Revenues, Cloud &     More   Shares of Microsoft fell 2% Tuesday, just one day before the firm is projected to report its quarterly financial results. So, let's take a look at what investors should expect from Microsoft's earnings after the closing bell Wednesday  Quick Overview  Microsoft has expanded into everything from IoT to cloud computing in recent years, while also maintaining its strength as a software and personal computer powerhouse. MSFT came in second only to Amazon last quarter in terms of cloud market share. The company has also grown its Xbox-driven gaming division through initiatives such as its Netflix-style Game Pass. MSFT stock closed regular trading Tuesday down 2.04% at $102.94 a share. This marked an 11.4% downturn from its 52-week high of $116.18 a share.  Q2 Outlook  Microsoft's quarterly revenues are projected to jump 12.3% from the year-ago period to hit $32.45 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. This would come up short of last quarter's 19% revenue growth, but match the year-ago period's 12% climb. Meanwhile, the tech powerhouse's adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to climb 13.54% to reach $1.09 per share. Again, this would mark a sequential slowdown compared to Q1 fiscal 2019's 36% bottom-line expansion.     Productivity & Business Processes  More specifically, MSFT's Productivity & Business Processes unit is projected to see its revenues jump nearly 13% to reach $10.096 billion, based on our current NFM consensus estimates. This division, which includes Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics CRM, saw its revenues pop 19% last quarter.  Intelligent Cloud  MSFT's Intelligent Cloud revenues are expected to surge 19% to touch $9.295 billion. This closely watched unit surged 24% last quarter and 15% in the year-ago period.  MOre Personal Computing  Lastly, More Personal Computing is expected to see its revenues climb 7.5% to touch $13.086 billion. This would mark a downturn from last quarter's 15% jump in MSFT's largest business segment that includes Windows.

Microsoft is set to report its Q2 fiscal 2019 financial results after the closing bell Wednesday. With that said, make sure to check back here for our full analysis of Microsoft's actual results.

266,"January 30, 2019, 09:08:59 AM EDT",AMZN,Trefis,How Did eBay Perform In Q4?,"
eBay ( EBAY  ) reported its Q4 results on January 29. While the company beat consensus estimates on revenue, the company's worsening metrics in the holiday quarter are a bit of a concern. Still, we are maintaining our price estimate of $37 per share  for eBay, which is around 10% higher than the current market price. Our interactive dashboard on  eBay's Price Estimate    outlines our forecasts and estimates for the company. You can modify any of the key drivers to visualize the impact of changes on its valuation.    Some key takeaways from eBay's Q4 are below:makeArticleAd();  Active buyers grew to 179 million (+4% y-o-y) versus 5%   growth in Q4 last year Gross merchandise volume grew to $24.6 billion (+1% y-o-y)   versus 10% growth in Q4 last year Marketplace transaction revenues grew to $1.98 billion (+9%   y-o-y), of which 64% came from international (vs. 62% a year   ago) StubHub transaction revenues grew to $311 million (+2%   y-o-y), of which 6% came from international (vs. 6% a year   ago) Total transaction revenues grew to $2.295 billion (+8%   y-o-y), of which 56% came from international (vs. 54% a year   ago) Marketing revenues from the marketplace declined to $316   million (-5% y-o-y), of which 53% came from international (vs.   53% a year ago) Marketing revenues from classifieds grew to $263 million (8%   y-o-y) Total marketing revenues grew to $582 million (+1% y-o-y), of   which 74% came from international (vs. 73% a year ago) Total revenue grew to $2.88 billion (+6% y-o-y)  While some of eBay's operational metrics have seen some deceleration, which is a concern, the company's decision to initiate its first ever dividend seems to have pleased investors. However, it should be noted that this newfound focus on shareholder returns could be a corollary of activist investor Elliott Management buying a stake in the company. In addition to laying out plans for growth, eBay's management notes that 2019 is likely to be a year of consolidation, which will drive growth in 2020. The company's plan over the next two years looks like a familiar narrative to other companies in which Elliott has invested, so it remains to be seen how that will develop. In fact, with Elliott coming in, management may be forced to think more actively about its portfolio realignment (such as potential divestments of Classifieds or StubHub).

  Kohl's Corporation KSS  revealed intentions to collaborate with the new Weight Watchers - WW, a renowned wellness company. Per the deal, the companies plan to come up with a range of offerings in 2019, with focus on health and wellbeing. Let's take a closer look at this latest development and discuss its impact on Kohl's performance.  makeArticleAd(); Plans to Expand Wellness Offerings    With consumers becoming increasingly conscious regarding health, Kohl's latest move to augment offerings in this space is prudent.

The inclusion of such offerings is likely to aid Kohl's customers meet their health goals effectively. Moreover, these efforts are in line with the company's strategy to keep assortments aligned with consumers' preferences.   Sales-Boosting Efforts Bode Well    We note that management's constant efforts to boost sales have enabled the company to achieve positive comps for five straight quarters. In particular, strong brands have been boosting the company's sales. Some of the well-performing brands adorning the company's portfolio are Levi's, Under Armour UAA  , Nike NKE  , KitchenAid and Champion among others. Moreover, the company is strengthening ties with retail giant Amazon AMZN  to drive traffic.

268,"January 30, 2019, 08:44:06 AM EDT",AMZN,InvestorPlace Media,Is a Death Cross Brewing in Microsoft Stock?,"
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAmong its technology-centric competitors, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) suffered one of the least-worrisome bouts of volatility. While the contentious U.S.-China trade war impacted virtually everything, Microsoft stock lost 11% in the final quarter of 2018. Yes, it's significant but nothing like what Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) endured.makeArticleAd();A key reason for MSFT stock holding its ground is product diversity. Unlike Apple, which is highly leveraged to its flagship iPhone, Microsoft has multiple robust revenue channels. The company has successfully moved into the cloud-computing space, while its legacy businesses like hardware have gained momentum.However, a recent blip on the radar aroused some anxious looks on Wall Street. For the Tuesday session, the MSFT stock price closed down 2%. With the nervous trading, Microsoft's 50-day moving average (DMA) is on the verge of crossing underneath its 200-DMA.This phenomenon is what traders refer to as the dreaded ""death cross.""Theoretically, it suggests that sentiment has weakened in Microsoft stock: more traders are piling on the bearish trade, causing bystanders to follow suit.10 Stocks to Sell in FebruaryBut should investors heed the death cross' warning, or are folks reading too deeply into this issue?The Death Cross Reflects Reality for Microsoft StockAny conversation that involves the death cross invariably invokes the debate between technical analysis versus fundamental analysis. Often, skeptics blast these technical patterns as nothing more than tea-leaf reading exercises.However, this is not an entirely fair assessment. For one thing, recurring patterns do show up throughout various stocks, funds and market indices. Perhaps the most common indicator, the bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, reliably warns investors not to pile in on a peaking asset.According to SamuraiTradingAcademy.com , the head-and-shoulders pattern has an 83% accuracy rate . I'd take this specific metric with a grain of salt. Admittedly, technical patterns are difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, this phenomenon features prominently in multiple analyses, including from mainstream sources such as CNBC .In addition, popular trading resource StockCharts.comwrites extensively about the head-and-shoulders. Founded in 1999 , StockCharts.com has covered countless companies, both large and small. If technical analysis wasn't at least somewhat successful, I doubt this company would remain in business.Furthermore, the death cross itself reflects a simple reality with Microsoft stock; that is, the magnitude of bearishness has overtaken bullish sentiment. Therefore, on average, MSFT looks shaky at the moment.Unfortunately, the term ""death cross"" is applied mostly for the optics. Again, what we're really saying is that negative trades have recently overshadowed bullish ones. From here, proponents of the technical approach deduct that MSFT stock likely faces troubled waters.Why the Death Cross Doesn't MatterOn the other hand, people shouldn't overreact on Microsoft stock simply due to the death cross. While the indicator reflects real, historical pricing mechanisms, its interpretation is inconclusive.Primarily, the biggest obstacle in deciphering the death cross is context. Unlike other patterns, the death cross is easy to define: a nearer-term moving day average drops below its longer-term counterpart. However, running a death cross analysis on every asset similar to MSFT stock is onerous.Sadly, that's what we must do if we are to glean useful information from a death-cross flashing …How accurate was this indicator in predicting Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ), or Sony's (NYSE: SNE ), decline? Without this context, it's hard to know what we're really looking at.After all, tech firms typically experience more volatility than, say, consumer staples. Even an established stalwart like Microsoft can suffer severe falls if it meets a fundamental challenge. It's no secret that the tech industry moves at the speed of light. Any hiccup could result in devastation.Yet the opposite is also true. We've all seen companies in this sector move incredibly fast based on a positive news feed. This movement makes it difficult to confirm that a death cross necessarily equates to doom and gloom.Final Thoughts on MSFT stockUltimately, I think this is much ado about nothing. While a death cross should always warrant investigation, we must also consider the bigger picture. In this case, MSFT stock tripped up along with everyone else during the October selloff.But as I mentioned earlier, Microsoft shares mitigated their losses far better than its peers. That tells me that while the immediate sentiment is negative, the company should find its way back higher. Plus, after several years of positive trading, a correction is both healthy and natural.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long SNE.More From InvestorPlace2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid10 Smart Money Stocks to Buy for the Rest of the Year10 Best Consumer Stocks to Buy in 201910 Triple-A Stocks to Buy in FebruaryCompare BrokersThe post Is a Death Cross Brewing in Microsoft Stock? appeared first on InvestorPlace .

273,"January 30, 2019, 06:30:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Can Amazon and Walmart Disrupt the Shipping Business?,"
 Not that many years ago, consumers would order a product to   come through the mail, and it would take weeks to arrive.   Sometimes, there was an option to pay more -- usually a   lot    more -- for faster service, but the phrase ""wait four to six   weeks for delivery"" was a familiar one. Those days have gone the way of pay phones and 12 CDs for a   penny, as   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) has fundamentally changed consumer expectations of   delivery. The paid Amazon Prime service has made two-day delivery   the bare minimum, and that led to   Walmart    (NYSE: WMT) embracing two-day shipping while offering it for free   (with   certain restrictions    ). The problem with offering two-day shipping is that it's   expensive and cuts into already thin margins. That has forced   both Amazon and Walmart to rethink how they ship items, both to   their warehouses and stores and to end customers.makeArticleAd();   Walmart has been adding experienced truck drivers. Image     source: Walmart.  What are Amazon and Walmart doing? Of the two retailers, Amazon has been more innovative. The   online leader has been building out its own delivery network,   which includes increasing its fleet of tractor-trailers to   helping entrepreneurs    build van-based delivery businesses that bring goods directly to   customers' doors. Amazon has also made a bold pitch to not just serve its own   needs but also to help third-party sellers on its platform. The   company recently expanded its Amazon Shipping program beyond its   initial test markets of London and Los Angeles, reports    The Wall Street Journal     (subscription required). To entice shippers to use its service, Amazon has dropped many   of the fees that rival shippers   UPS    (NYSE: UPS) and   FedEx    (NYSE: FDX)  normally charge. That includes ""extra charges   to deliver packages to homes, during the peak holiday season, or   on weekends,"" the paper reports. These residential surcharge fees are not small, running around   $3.80 per package for both carriers, or about 40% of the average   ground delivery charge,   WSJ's    Paul Ziobro added. By dropping them, as well as other charges,   such as seasonal or fuel surcharges, Amazon can grab more   business, theoretically making its trucks more efficient by   allowing for more deliveries at a lower cost. Walmart isn't being as bold. It is, however, expanding its   army of truck drivers. The company added 1,400 in 2018 and has   plans to add hundreds more this year. The retail giant is hiring not just drivers, but   experienced    drivers who have at least 30 months under their belt, and is   paying them well. The company is offering wages that come out to   just under $90,000 a year. That's a number that should be very   attractive in an industry where the average median salary comes   in at $53,000 a year, according to a 2018 American Trucking   Association survey. Walmart's starting rates for truck drivers should give it an   edge over UPS and FedEx, which pay drivers closer to $60,000 per   year, based on data from TruckDriverSalary.com. Benefits and   bonuses may bring the numbers closer, but in a time where there's   a   significant shortage    of experienced truck drivers, Walmart's hiring spree may hurt the   established players in the space. Is a shipping war coming? Amazon is taking on more of its own shipping both for   efficiency and to hedge against price increases -- not from UPS   and FedEx, but from the United States Postal Service. It's also   banking on the idea that its technology and ability to predict   what will be ordered and where will allow it to increase shipping   efficiency -- something that will increase as it adds more volume   through increased third-party business. Walmart's efforts are more traditionally disruptive. The   company has acknowledged that there aren't enough experienced   drivers to go around, and it has made its play to hire the ones   it needs, which may come at the expense of the traditional   employers in the field. The two retailers are serving their own needs first, but their   efforts are going to have a ripple effect. It's possible that UPS   and FedEx will have to raise wages to attract or retain drivers,   and it's equally likely that both trucking companies will have to   work to lower costs or risk losing business to Amazon. This isn't a full-fledged shipping war yet, but it threatens   to become one. Walmart and Amazon both need to keep pushing   delivery costs down, a need that will only increase as one-day   and even same-day shipping becomes more common. FedEx and UPS   will have to keep up, or else they'll find themselves shut out of   segments of a market they once dominated.   10 stocks we like better than Walmart       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Shares are currently trading within 10% of its 52-week lows.In his earnings preview, RBC Capital's Mark Mahaney describes GOOGL as a ""top large cap long for 2019,"" explaining that the stock benefits from ""extremely consistent Fundamental Trends, and with pole position against arguably the biggest product cycle in Tech - autonomous vehicles.""By the numbers, Mahaney is looking for gross revenues of $38.90 billion, net revenues of $31.41 billion, fueling GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) operating income of $8.64 billion and GAAP earnings of $11.03 per share.Drilling down, Core Google gross revenue (the vast majority of Alphabet's business) should improve 20% year-over-year to $38.72 billion, and Core Google net revenues should hit $31.23 billion (up 21% year-over-year). This performance would be driven by ongoing strength in Mobile Search, YouTube and Programmatic.""The largest Ad Revenue-based 'Net business has averaged 23% growth for 35 (keep counting 'em) straight quarters & shows no signs of slowing,"" Mahaney cheers, ""despite a $130 billion revenue run-rate.""

The company reported ""tens of millions"" of new Prime trials/memberships globally, while customers' use of Alexa for shopping more than tripled year-over-year.""We believe AMZN exceeded its domestic gross profit estimates on strong macro holiday sales and continued share gains, supported by Adobe Insights and Similarweb,"" Mahaney writes. The five-star analyst has an AMZN price target of $2,300 (44% upside potential), and in fact, RBC says this tech large cap has the least risk heading into earnings.For the December quarter, Mahaney expects $70.9 billion in revenues, $3.5 billion in GAAP operating income and $5.49 in GAAP EPS. He also expects big growth out of Amazon Web Services, the company's rapidly expanding cloud segment, modeling in 42% year-over-year growth to $7.3 billion in sales. Gartner currently estimates AWS's worldwide market segment share at 51.8%, which is larger than the next four competitors combined.Mahaney points out that the company has put together 65 straight quarters (with one exception) of 20%-plus organic revenue growth, and while profit has been uneven, it's been uneven on the right side.

""Best of breed (free cash flow) margins (33% in Q3) coupled with robust, consistent revenue growth.""This trend should continue into Q4. The internet data storage company is guiding for fourth-quarter sales of $367 million to $370 million, which would imply strong 20% to 21% year-over-year growth. And Mahaney thinks DBX can come in at the high end, estimating $370 million.Also pay attention to user growth. While Dropbox grew paying users by 400,000 in Q3, net paid additions for Q4 are anticipated to come in at a comparatively low 200,000. But average revenue per user (ARPU) should rise 5.5% year-over-year to $119.""Already over 50% of the Fortune 500 deploy Dropbox Business Teams in some capacity, and the company believes it has employee users in over 90% of the Fortune 500,"" Mahaney writes, but adds, ""If Dropbox were to materially penetrate the Enterprise market, we continue to believe the company may be able to triple its Paying User count over the medium to long term.""Overall, the analyst is very bullish about DBX's prospects, reflected by an ""Outperform"" rating and a $37 price target (60% upside potential).

( ROKU , $42.85) is among the lowest-risk plays, heading into earnings, in the mid- and small-cap space, Mahaney says. He's optimistic about the company's recent positive metrics release, coupled with some encouraging takeaways from a recent management meeting in Las Vegas.ROKU released Q4 active accounts and streaming hours metrics on Jan. 4. The former came in around 27 million (up 40% YoY), and the latter hit 7.3 billion (up 68%).Mahaney is predicting revenues of $261 million for the fourth quarter. He also recommends keeping a close eye out for Platform ARPU, which should hit $17.81 for Q4 (up 29%).""Given a base of less than $200MM in '17 Ad Revenue and a $70B U.S. TV Advertising market, we believe ROKU can sustain high Platform Revenue growth for several years,"" Mahaney concludes. He has a $70 price target on ROKU shares right now, indicating he thinks the stock can surge more than 60% from current levels.For further stock insights, turn to TipRanks' ROKU Research Report .SEE ALSO: 10 Value Stocks to Buy for 2019 and BeyondThe Trade DeskMarket value: $5.8 billionTipRanks consensus rating: Moderate BuyExpected earnings release: Mid-February (Expected)Tech stock The Trade Desk ( TTD , $134.56) bills itself as a company that empowers advertising buyers. In short, it's an online demand-side platform that provides buying tools for digital media purchasers.It also boasts the title of RBC Capital's top small-cap long for 2019.Mahaney calls TTD one of the best ""Crucial Combos in 'Net Land,"" in that it generates consistent 50%-plus revenue growth and 30% EBITDA margins. For the quarter, he sees revenues hitting $147 million, with adjusted EBITDA reaching $52.5 million.The Trade Desk recently released its biggest product launch ever. Called ""The Next Wave,"" this launch includes a new media planner, a new user interface and a new artificial-intelligence engine. These are all designed to help its client's better design, implement and monitor programmatic ad campaigns.""Next Wave rollout amounts to a major product cycle that should help FY19 results, along with International expansion,"" Mahaney writes. Thanks to New Wave, he thinks Wall Street's assumption of 33% revenue growth in fiscal 2019 as reasonably conservative.This stock has multiple drives ahead, from secular programmatic ad growth to Google GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) issues to connected-TV growth to international expansion. As a result, the analyst's ""Outperform"" rating comes with a $170 price target (26% upside potential), notably higher than the Street's $122 average price target.

279,"January 29, 2019, 09:20:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Will Amazon.com's Record-Breaking Holiday Sales Lead to Better-Than-Expected Results?,"
 It was a busy year for   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) in 2018. The company hit a number of impressive   milestones, including briefly topping   a $1 trillion market cap    before being hit by the year-end correction. Amazon made headway   in a number of promising areas of its business and made   impressive inroads into others. The strength of the company's   underlying operations propelled its stock to new heights, and   Amazon trounced the broader market, gaining more than 28%   compared with a 6% loss by the   S&P 500    . Amazon is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter results   after the market close on Thursday, Jan. 31. Let's look back at   its third quarter and review some recent developments for any   insight into the company's earnings.   Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();  A disappointing quarter? For   the third quarter    , Amazon's revenue grew 29% year over year to nearly $56.6   billion while earnings per share surged more than 10X to reach   $5.75. Revenue came in just shy of analysts' consensus estimates   of $57 billion, while profits soared past expectations of $3.10   per share. Amazon saw strength across all its operating segments.   Operating margins improved across the board, and while the   international segment has yet to reach profitability, operating   loss margins improved from a negative 6.8% in the prior-year   quarter to negative 2.5%. Operating margins in North American   soared more than 13-fold year over year from 0.4% to 5.9%. Amazon   Web Services also boasted improvement, climbing from 25% of sales   in the year-ago period to 31%. These impressive gains in   operating margins all contributed to the company's soaring   profitability. The company revealed that Amazon Business, its   business-to-business platform, had achieved a   run rate    of more than   $10 billion per year    , and listed a host of impressive statistics regarding the number   of Fortune 500 companies, local governments, hospitals, and   educational institutions that make up its customer base. Another segment that is quickly coming into focus for Amazon   is its advertising business. The company has reported   triple-digit growth in each of the past three quarters, and is   expected to top   $10 billion in revenue    for 2018. Current events One of the biggest contributors to the upcoming results will   be the holiday shopping season. Just before the sun set on 2018,    Amazon   report    ed that it had seen a   record-breaking holiday season    , selling more items worldwide than ever before. The company also   shared a few metrics regarding the results. Amazon said that voice-controlled shopping with Alexa more   than tripled from the same time last year, and that millions of   Prime members used Alexa for such purchases. The company also   said that tens of millions of customers globally started a free   trial or paid membership with Prime, and that Amazon shipped more   than 1 billion items free to Prime subscribers. In addition, the   company sold millions more Amazon-branded devices during the   holidays compared to a year ago. The biggest sellers were   the newest edition of the Echo Dot, the 4K Fire TV stick with   Alexa remote, and its top-of-the-line Echo smart speaker. The holidays weren't the only contributor that could boost the   company's results.   Image source: Amazon.  Earlier this month, Amazon's IMDb announced the debut of its   Freedive streaming video service    , an ad-supported platform that will feature hit TV shows and   movies -- and will certainly add to the company's quickly growing   advertising coffers. A look ahead For the fourth quarter, Amazon is anticipating revenue of   between $66.5 billion and $72.5 billion, which would result in   year-over-year growth between 10% and 20%. The company is also   forecasting operating income in a range of $2.1 billion to $3.6   billion, which would represent year-over-year growth ranging from   flat to an increase of about 71%. While we don't want to fall into the trap of short-term   thinking, looking to Wall Street's expectations can provide   broader context regarding overall market sentiment for the   company. Analysts' consensus estimates are calling for revenue of   $71.87 billion -- an increase of 18.9%, coming near the top of   Amazon's guided range -- and EPS of $5.67, an increase of   163%. With so many ways to achieve growth and profitability, it's   hard to bet against Amazon. Investors should just buy shares and   hold on for the ride, as I see a company that is positioned to   soar over the coming decade, though it won't always play out in   the shorter term.

280,"January 29, 2019, 06:55:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,"Facebook (FB) Q4 Earnings Preview: Monthly Active Users, Revenue & More","
 Shares of Facebook FB  dipped over 2% during regular trading Tuesday, only a day before the firm is set to report its Q4 earnings. So, let's dive into what investors should expect from the embattled social media firm after the closing bell Wednesday.  Quick Overview  At this point, most casual followers of the news understand that Facebook had a terrible 2018. FB stock tumbled following its Cambridge Analytica scandal and eventually plummeted in the second half of the year after the firm announced that it committed billions of dollars to clean up and safeguard its platform. Facebook said these initiatives would likely cause its operating margin to fall into the ""mid-30s on a percentage basis"" over a more than two-year period-its operating margin fell from 50% in Q3 2017 to 42% last quarter. Despite worries about increased government scrutiny and intervention, Facebook seems likely to remain a digital advertising powerhouse, along with Google GOOGL  , for years to come. Plus, Facebook plans to expand its video offerings as the entertainment industry moves more toward the Netflix NFLX  and Amazon Prime AMZN  model.  Facebook stock  closed regular trading down 2.22% at $144.19 a share, which represented a roughly 34% downturn from its 52-week high of $218.62 per share.     Q4 Estimates  Facebook's Q4 revenues are projected to climb 26.2% from the prior-year quarter to hit $16.37 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Investors should note that this would mark a slowdown compared to Q3's 33% top-line expansion, Q2's 42% climb, and Q1's 49% surge. Meanwhile, FB's adjusted Q4 earnings are projected to slip 1.36% to touch $2.17 a share.  User Growth  Wall Street will also pay close attention to Facebook's user totals. Facebook's monthly active user base in the U.S. & Canada is projected to grow by roughly 1.6% to 242.93 million, based on our most updated NFM estimates-this region accounted for 49% of Q3 revenues. On top of that, FB's European MAU total is expected to climb 2.4% to reach 378.79 million. This would also mark an increase from Q3 2018's 375 million and might be a good sign after three straight quarters of sequential declines in the region that accounts for roughly a quarter of Facebook's revenues.   Overall, Facebook is projected to see its global MAU total jump roughly 9.4% from 2.13 billion in Q4 2017 to reach 2.33 billion, with much of this growth driven by the Asia-Pacific and ""Rest of World"" regions. Our NFM projection would see the social media firm nearly match last quarter's MAU growth.     Bottom Line  Facebook is scheduled to release its Q4 financial results after the closing bell Wednesday. Meanwhile, fellow market giants Microsoft MSFT  , Boeing BA  , Qualcomm QCOM  , Alibaba BABA  , Visa V  , Tesla TSLA  , and others are set to report as well. Facebook is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and it might have to blow away investors to see a post-earnings bump over the next few days. So, make sure to come back here for a complete breakdown of FB's actual Q4 results.  Wall Street's Next Amazon  makeArticleAd();   Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

 Shares of Microsoft MSFT  fell 2% Tuesday, just one day before the firm is projected to report its quarterly financial results along with fellow market giants Boeing BA  , Facebook FB  , Qualcomm QCOM  , Alibaba BABA  , Visa V  , Tesla TSLA  , and many more. So, let's take a look at what investors should expect from Microsoft's earnings after the closing bell Wednesday  Quick Overview  Microsoft has expanded into everything from IoT to cloud computing in recent years, while also maintaining its strength as a software and personal computer powerhouse. MSFT came in second only to Amazon AMZN  last quarter in terms of cloud market share. The company has also grown its Xbox-driven gaming division through initiatives such as its Netflix NFLX  -style Game Pass-which Apple AAPL  is reportedly ready to test out.  makeArticleAd();  MSFT stock closed regular trading Tuesday down 2.04% at $102.94 a share. This marked an 11.4% downturn from its 52-week high of $116.18 a share.       Q2 Outlook  Microsoft's quarterly revenues are projected to jump 12.3% from the year-ago period to hit $32.45 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. This would come up short of last quarter's 19% revenue growth, but match the year-ago period's 12% climb. Meanwhile, the tech powerhouse's adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to climb 13.54% to reach $1.09 per share. Again, this would mark a sequential slowdown compared to Q1 fiscal 2019's 36% bottom-line expansion.     Productivity & Business Processes  More specifically, MSFT's Productivity & Business Processes unit is projected to see its revenues jump nearly 13% to reach $10.096 billion, based on our current NFM consensus estimates. This division, which includes Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics CRM, saw its revenues pop 19% last quarter.  Intelligent Cloud  MSFT's Intelligent Cloud revenues are expected to surge 19% to touch $9.295 billion. This closely watched unit surged 24% last quarter and 15% in the year-ago period.  More Personal Computing  Lastly, More Personal Computing is expected to see its revenues climb 7.5% to touch $13.086 billion. This would mark a downturn from last quarter's 15% jump in MSFT's largest business segment that includes Windows.     Bottom Line  Microsoft is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) based mostly on its recen t earnings  estimate revision activity. Microsoft is set to report its Q2 fiscal 2019 financial results after the closing bell Wednesday. With that said, make sure to check back here for our full analysis of Microsoft's actual results.

282,"January 29, 2019, 05:04:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Top Storylines to Emerge from Busy Week of Tech Earnings,"
     On today's episode of the Tech Talk Tuesday podcast, Ryan McQueeney highlights the top storylines and talking points to watch during this packed week for major tech sector earnings reports. Remember to subscribe and leave a rating on Apple Podcasts  if you enjoy the show! Earnings season is in full throttle, as this week will see fresh data from some of the world's largest and most influential technology companies. Wall Street, individual investors, and the financial media will be keen to learn about the latest data from these companies, as well as the new storylines these reports might reveal. For Apple AAPL  , which will report this afternoon, the storyline is likely known already. The iPhone maker this month issued its first profit warning in over 15 years, citing sluggish performance in its Greater China region as the primary reason for the missed guidance. But what will Apple say next? Should investors expect the company's China woes to continue, or was this quarter's underperformance simply a bump in the road? Will Tim Cook and the rest of Apple's management focus on a different region entirely for the next phase of growth? These are all questions Apple investors will be looking for answers to today, and such considerations will dominate the conversation moving forward. Similarly, Facebook FB  will face a number of questions this week about the future of its business. The social media gian t report  s on Wednesday, and analysts are expecting its adjusted earnings per share figures to contract from last year. This is because Facebook is spending tons of cash to address content abuse and data privacy issues, which have become a major headwind for the stock. Another tech behemoth reporting on Wednesday, Microsoft MSFT  , will play a large part in a separate conversation. Microsoft will hope its report can prove that it is making up ground on Amazon AMZN  , which reports on Thursday afternoon. Amazon, the worldwide leader in e-commerce, and software pioneer Microsoft might not compete in many of their business ventures, but the two are key rivals in the public cloud industry. Amazon operates the largest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, while Microsoft's Azure platform is trudging along in second. This week's reports will give us the latest update in the cloud war.

283,"January 29, 2019, 05:00:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,"How Much Does Subscription Sharing Cost Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu?","
 It seems innocent enough. You ""borrow"" your parents' login for   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) , Hulu, or   Amazon.com    's (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime so you don't have to pay for your own.   And, on an individual level, subscription sharing is a pretty   minor crime. On an aggregate basis, however, it's a massive problem that's   costing the three leading streaming services hundreds of millions   of dollars.makeArticleAd();   There are rules as to how streaming accounts can be shared.     Image source: Getty Images.  How big is the problem? While it's not the top streaming offering,      Hulu    is the service where people are most likely to share an account,   with 19.2% doing so, according to a   survey    from CordCutting.com, a blog dedicated to covering cord-cutting,   streaming, and free over-the-air options. Stephen Lovely, a   Fool.com    freelancer, is the editor of      Cordcutting.com    . Hulu is followed by   Amazon Prime    , where 16.5% of those surveyed said they used a shared account.   Netflix    brought up the rear at 15%, which suggests that perceived value   is a factor. Since Netflix has a larger offering with many more   hit original series, consumers may be more willing to pay for it.   With the other two, more people might want to watch only a show   or two, so borrowing seems like a reasonable option. This survey, however, comes before consumers feel the impact   of Netflix   raising prices    . The company increased its lowest-level low-resolution   single-stream plan to $9 a month from $8, while its core HD,   two-stream plan will cost $13 instead of $11. And that could make   more people willing to consider breaking the rules by sharing an   account. Of course, some of the people mooching accounts from relatives   and friends would simply go without if they could not share an   account without paying for it. Still, it's fair to assume that   some percentage of these consumers would pay if they were put   into a situation where they had to.   Image source: CordCutting.com.  What can the streamers do? Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime are leaving a lot of potential   money on the table by not implementing ways to cut down on   sharing. The problem is that doing so isn't easy, and it could   come with customer service backlash. In general, all three   services allow the account to be shared by members of the   household. That does not mean it can only be used at home or by people   under the same roof at the same time. On a two-stream Netflix   account, for example, you may be watching in a hotel room while   your spouse watches at home. That's a legal use, but it could   look like fraud, and enforcing the rules could result in major   customer frustration. In addition, some lighter-use Hulu and Netflix subscribers   might justify not dropping the service because another friend or   family member uses their account. If either company started   making efforts to stop sharing, it's possible that some of these   subscribers could drop out. (Amazon Prime would face less impact,   as most members sign up to get free two-day shipping, and the   video service is an add-on.) Revenue is being lost here, but it's likely well below the   numbers in the charts above. Streaming services should want   consumers to pay if they're watching, but enforcing rules about   account sharing could have unintended consequences. That's why all three of these companies will tread lightly and   will probably continue to ignore some account sharing even when   they know it's probably occurring. It's also possible that one of   the three comes up with a family plan allowing parents and   siblings to pay more to share one account (an option some   wireless phone providers have pushed in the past).   10 stocks we like better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Apple services business grows; CEO Cook says China tensions ease


By Stephen Nellis and Sonam Rai
Jan 29 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  reported sharp growth in its services business on Tuesday and Chief Executive Tim Cook said trade tensions between the United States and China were easing, helping boost the company's shares after hours even though iPhone sales dipped in the holiday shopping quarter for the first time.
Apple said sales for the current quarter would most likely be lower than Wall Street expected, a signal that it continues to face weak demand for the iPhone, especially in China, the world's biggest smartphone market.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
""The services number is good, and that is the growth engine going forward that people will continue to focus on,"" said Ivan Feinseth, an analyst with Tigress Financial Partners.
Cook, who is in regular contact with U.S. President Donald Trump, said there were signs of a detente in trade tensions with China, which may have depressed sales of its phones.
""If you were to graph up trade tension it's clearly less in January than it was in December,"" Cook told Reuters in an interview. ""I'm optimistic that the two countries will be able to work things out.""
The company's shares rose 6 percent to $163.50 in after-hours trading. They had fallen more than 30 percent since November on concerns about weak iPhone sales and a general decline in high-tech stocks. Shares of iPhone suppliers including Micron Technology , Broadcom Inc and Skyworks Solutions rose more than 1 percent in extended trade after Apple's report. 
""It appears that the bears pressed way too hard on the negative bets and even this more negative report couldn't drive the stock lower,"" said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel.


SUBSCRIBERS UP
Apple said revenue from services, which investors are counting on to fuel growth, reached $10.8 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates. Services gross margin hit 63 percent, up from 58.3 percent a year ago. Analysts previously estimated the services gross margin could top 60 percent.
""They get more efficient as they get larger,"" Cook told Reuters.
The company said it has 360 million subscribers to both its own and third-party services, and set a goal to expand that to 500 million by the end of 2020. It said it has 1.4 billion active devices, an increase of 100 million from last year, and that 900 million of those are iPhones.
Apple said it would start providing regular updates on the number of iPhones and overall devices in use - what is known in the tech industry as the installed base. The company stopped reporting unit sales of its iPhones the latest quarter.
Apple counts both subscribers to its own services as well as Apple device users who subscribe to outside apps or services using Apple's payment systems. Apple keeps up to 30 percent of the payments it handles.
Apple's iPhone revenue declined 15 percent year-over-year to $51.9 billion. Cook said China's economic weakness hurt iPhone sales there.
He said Apple is rethinking how it prices the iPhone outside the United States after largely setting the price in U.S. dollars, which made the phones more expensive in local currencies as the dollar strengthened.
In markets with currencies that weakened considerably against the dollar over the last year, iPhone price ""increases were obviously more,"" Cook told Reuters. ""And so as we've gotten into January and assessed the macroeconomic condition in some of those markets, we've decided to go back to more commensurate with what our local prices were a year ago in hopes of helping the sales in those areas.""


OUTLOOK LARGELY BELOW WALL STREET
Apple said it expects revenue between $55 billion and $59 billion for the current quarter ending in March, largely below analysts' average estimate of $58.83 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Earnings per share were $4.18, compared with Wall Street's average estimate of $4.17, according to Refinitiv data.
Investors have been closely tracking the company's share repurchase activity in hopes that it will help buoy the falling share price, which has knocked Apple off its throne as the world's largest technology company with a market value of more than $1 trillion.
Apple said it bought back $8.2 billion worth of shares in the quarter ended in December, less than half the $19.4 billion it purchased in the quarter ended in September. Apple said its net cash position - cash minus its debt - was $130 billion, up from $123 billion in the previous quarter. Apple has publicly said it plans to draw its net cash position to zero.
Some investors were disappointed Apple did not take advantage of low prices over the last quarter to buy back more stock. Ross Gerber, chief executive of Santa Monica, California-based Apple shareholder Gerber Kawasaki, said that Cook ""is very annoying in this way"" and was ""just playing the game so safely."" 
""Tim just wants to be predictable and it seems to be working for now,"" Gerber said.

Jan 29 (Reuters) - Wall Street was mixed on Tuesday, with Alphabet, Facebook and other technology-related shares dipping, while a rebound in 3M and other industrials elevated the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Apple Inc  jumped 4 percent in extended trade after the iPhone maker posted quarterly results following its warning earlier this month that revenue would be less than previously expected due to softness in China, whose economy has been damaged by a trade war with the United States.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Interest rates were also in focus as the Federal Reserve began a two-day monetary policy meeting. After raising rates gradually last year, the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach to further tightening in the face of an overseas slowdown and market volatility. 
The Fed is widely expected to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday, and investors will look to Friday's January jobs report for clues about the pace of future inflation.
""It's a day of indecision. I don't think anyone wants to make a big bet ahead of all that news,"" Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird, said of corporate earnings, the Fed decision and the employment report.
The S&P industrials index, which took a beating after a warning from Caterpillar  on Monday, rebounded 1.37 percent, helped by better-than-expected reports from 3M Co  and defense companies.
Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc  and Microsoft Corp, which are all due to report quarterly results later this week, fell more than 2 percent each.
The S&P technology index  lost 1.01 percent.
Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies' aggregate earnings per share to have risen 14.2 percent in the fourth quarter. But with U.S. corporate tax cuts now a year old, 2019 earnings are seen rising a more moderate 5.6 percent.
As Washington and Beijing officials prepare for a high-level trade meeting this week, the Justice Department leveled charges against Chinese telecom giant Huawei, potentially casting a cloud on the talks. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 0.21 percent to end at 24,579.96 points, while the S&P 500  lost 0.15 percent to 2,640, dragged down by technology and communications stocks. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 0.81 percent to 7,028.29.
Defense contractors L3 Technologies Inc  jumped 8.44 percent and Harris Corp  climbed 8.78 percent after topping quarterly earnings estimates.
3M rose 1.94 percent after its fourth-quarter results beat  estimates, even as the Post-It notes maker trimmed its 2019 earnings outlook, saying that a slowdown at its Chinese business was hurting revenue. 
Harley-Davidson Inc  dropped 5.05 percent after the motorcycle maker reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, hit by declining sales in the United States. 
Allergan Plc  fell 8.55 percent after the Botox maker forecast 2019 revenue below expectations. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.42-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 31 new highs and 29 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.9 billion shares, compared with the 7.6 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

By Stephen Nellis
Jan 29 (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday reported sharp growth in its services business and Chief Executive Tim Cook said trade tensions between the United States and China were easing, helping its shares up even after sales of its iPhone dipped in the holiday shopping quarter. 
Apple said sales for its fiscal second quarter would most likely be lower than Wall Street expected, a signal that it continues to face weak demand for its iPhone, especially in China, the world's biggest smartphone market, but investors focused on the company's growing services, which include Apple Music and its App Store. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
The company's shares rose 6 percent to $163.50 in after-hours trading.
Cook, who is in regular contact with U.S. President Donald Trump, said trade tensions with China, which may have depressed sales of its phones, were easing. 
""If you were to graph up trade tension it's clearly less in January than it was in December,"" Cook told Reuters in an interview. ""I'm optimistic that the two countries will be able to work things out.""


SUBSCRIBERS UP
Apple said revenue from services, which investors are counting on to fuel growth, reached $10.8 billion, in line with Wall Street estimates. Services gross margin hit 63 percent.
The company said it now has 360 million subscribers to both its own and third-party services, and set a goal to expand that to 500 million by the end of 2020. It said it now has 1.4 billion active devices, an increase of 100 million from last year, and that 900 million of those are iPhones.
By contrast, streaming service Netflix Inc  ended 2018 with 139 million paid subscribers and Amazon.com Inc  has more than 100 million subscribers to its Prime shipping and content service.
However, Apple counts both subscribers to its own services as well as Apple device users who subscribe to outside apps or services using Apple's payment systems. Apple keeps up to 30 percent of the payments it handles.
Apple's iPhone revenue declined 15 percent year over year to $51.9 billion. Cook said China's economic weakness hurt iPhone sales there. 
He said Apple is rethinking how it prices the iPhone outside the United States after largely setting the price in U.S. dollars, which made the phones more expensive in local currencies.
""When you look at foreign currencies and then particularly those markets that weakened over the last year those (iPhone price) increases were obviously more,"" Cook told Reuters. ""And so as we've gotten into January and assessed the macroeconomic condition in some of those markets we've decided to go back to more commensurate with what our local prices were a year ago in hopes of helping the sales in those areas.""


OUTLOOK LARGELY BELOW WALL STREET 
Apple said it expects revenue between $55 billion and $59 billion for the current quarter ending in March, largely below analysts' average estimate of $58.83 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Apple reported earnings per share of $4.18 for the December quarter, compared with Wall Street's average estimate of $4.17, according to Refinitiv data.
The company's investors have been closely tracking the company's share repurchase activity in hopes that it will help buoy the share price, which has fallen more than 30 percent since November, knocking Apple off its throne as the world's largest technology company with a market value of more than $1 trillion. 
Apple said it returned $13 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks in the quarter ended in December, a far smaller figure than the $19.4 billion in stock it purchased in the previous quarter ended in September. Apple said its net cash position - its cash minus its debt - was $130 billion, an increase from $123 billion in the previous quarter. Apple has publicly said it plans to draw its net cash position to zero.

Jan 29 (Reuters) - EBay Inc  on Tuesday forecast March quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates after reporting disappointing growth in the sales volume on its platform during the key holiday quarter, overshadowing news of its first-ever dividend.
Shares of the online marketplace were down 1 percent in after-hours trading, reversing course after an initial jump following eBay's move to pay a quarterly dividend of 14 cents per share.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
EBay said consumer spending in December, a normally busy shopping period, was slow despite more buyers using its platform.
Chief Executive Officer Devin Wenig also predicted more near-term pressure on eBay's gross merchandise volume (GMV) - the value of all products sold on its websites - as the company reduced some marketing spending. He said he was confident, however, the company would boost GMV in the long run and benefit from new ad sales and a payments initiative.
""We believe that the actions we're taking in '19 will set us up well,"" he said on a conference call with analysts.
EBay forecast revenue of $2.55 billion to $2.60 billion for the current quarter, compared with analysts' target of $2.66 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
GMV overall rose just 1 percent in the December quarter and also missed analysts' estimates, while it dipped 1 percent in the United States.
Still, results for the final quarter of 2018 showed eBay's sales had climbed 6.3 percent year-over-year to $2.88 billion, exceeding Wall Street's estimates.
A multi-year effort by eBay to make its platform simpler to users, by introducing grouped listings, personal recommendations and an easier-to-use payment process is helping attract shoppers.
EBay had 179 million active buyers at the end of the December quarter, about 2 million more than the previous quarter.
The company also announced an increase to its share buybacks by $4 billion, reflecting the influence of eBay's activist investors, said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson.
""The hope for eBay, in my opinion, is their ability to supplement the marketplace with advertising and a growing payments business, but I think the core marketplace is still a challenged business,"" he said.
EBay's quarterly profit from continuing operations reached $763 million, compared with a loss of $2.6 billion a year earlier, when eBay recorded a one-time expense of more than $3 billion.

By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Gold hit an eight-month high while world stock markets were mixed ahead of further U.S.-Sino trade talks, a raft of technology company results, including Apple's, and a Federal Reserve decision on U.S. interest rates.
The U.S. dollar traded little changed and oil prices rose after Washington slapped sanctions on Venezuela's state-owned oil firm in a bid to curb its crude exports as traders prepared for major events, including a key Brexit vote late in the day.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Sterling  fell sharply after a brief rise and was down 0.75 percent.
Investors expect the Fed, the U.S. central bank, to show a more cautious stance when policymakers release a statement on Wednesday after a two-day meeting. U.S. economic data in December that was softer than expected and a sharp downturn in financial markets are likely to keep the Fed from raising rates.
Equity markets in Europe rose as investors bid up stocks considered safer during times of economic uncertainty, such as utilities. However, a gauge of global stock performance edged lower as stocks on Wall Street fell amid a ream of mixed earnings reports and caution due to the U.S.-China trade spat.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe  was little changed, while the FTSEurofirst 300 index  of leading regional shares in Europe closed 0.8 percent higher.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 51.74 points, or 0.21 percent, to 24,579.96. The S&P 500  lost 3.85 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,640 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 57.40 points, or 0.81 percent, to 7,028.29.
The information glut this week will make it hard for people to reach a conclusion but the trade talks with China, which begin Wednesday, are the overriding issue for the world economy, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New York.
What Washington, and possibly Beijing, fail to understand is that the uncertainty about trade is slowing the global economy, which will show up in East Asian PMI manufacturing data for January to be released on Thursday, Kelly said.
""The biggest tax levy by Washington is an uncertainty tax, and it's the biggest threat to the markets and the economy this year,"" Kelly said.
Tensions were high after U.S. officials announced criminal charges against China's telecom giant Huawei for violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. 
For Asia, the blow was cushioned by promises of more Chinese stimulus but Beijing berated Washington for blocking tactics in its World Trade Organization appeal against U.S. tariffs. 
Amid the uncertainty, safe-haven gold  broke through $1,310 an ounce in spot prices to reach its highest since last May. 
U.S. gold futures  settled up 0.4 percent at $1,308.90 per ounce.
Oil price gains were capped by abundant supply and signs of a slowing Chinese economy. Brent crude oil futures  rose $1.39 to settle at $61.32 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures  gained $1.32 to settle at $53.31.
Market participants will have catalysts for trading all week, with more than one-fifth of companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index reporting results, including Amazon, Microsoft  and Facebook.
Apple Inc  reported earnings after the bell and said sales for its fiscal second quarter would most likely be lower than Wall Street expected.
The outlook suggested Apple still faces weak demand for its iPhone, especially in China, the world's biggest smartphone market. But Apple shares rose 4.3 percent in after-hours trading on upbeat comments from Chief Executive Tim Cook. 
U.S. Treasury yields fell across maturities as investors anticipated strong demand for $78 billion of new issues on sale later in the day and on data showing U.S. consumer confidence at its lowest since July 2017. 
Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes  rose 9/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.7116 percent.
The dollar index  rose 0.06 percent, while the euro  gained 0.01 percent to $1.1434. The Japanese yen  weakened 0.01 percent versus the greenback at 109.33 per dollar.

Jan 29 (Reuters) - Wall Street was mixed on Tuesday, with technology shares dipping ahead of Apple's quarterly report while a rebound in 3M and other industrials elevated the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Apple  declined 1.04 percent as investors awaited the iPhone maker's results after the bell following its warning earlier this month about soft demand in China, whose economy has been damaged by a trade war with the United States.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
The Fed is widely expected to leave rates unchanged on Wednesday, and investors will look to Friday's January jobs report for clues about the pace of future inflation.
""It's a day of indecision. Between earnings due out after hours today and the Fed tomorrow, and then the employment report coming up, I don't think anyone wants to make a big bet ahead of all that news,"" said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird.
The S&P industrials index, which took a beating after a warning from Caterpillar  on Monday, rebounded 1.74 percent, helped by better-than-expected reports from 3M Co  and defense companies.
Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc  and Microsoft Corp, all part of a wave of quarterly reports later this week, fell more than 2 percent each.
The S&P technology index  lost 1.01 percent.
Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies' aggregate earnings per share to have risen 14.2 percent in the fourth quarter. But with U.S. corporate tax cuts now a year old, 2019 earnings are seen rising a more moderate 5.6 percent.
As Washington and Beijing officials prepare for a high-level trade meeting this week, the Justice Department leveled charges against Chinese telecom giant Huawei, potentially casting a cloud on the talks. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 0.21 percent to end at 24,579.96 points, while the S&P 500  lost 0.15 percent to 2,640, dragged down by technology and communications stocks. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 0.81 percent to 7,028.29.
Defense contractors L3 Technologies Inc  jumped 8.44 percent and Harris Corp  climbed 8.78 percent after topping quarterly earnings estimates.
3M rose 1.94 percent after its fourth-quarter results topped estimates, even as the Post-It notes maker trimmed its 2019 earnings outlook, saying that a slowdown at its Chinese business was hurting revenue. 
Harley-Davidson Inc  dropped 5.05 percent after the motorcycle maker reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit, hit by declining sales in the United States. 
Allergan Plc  fell 8.55 percent after the Botox maker forecast 2019 revenue below expectations.

Jan 29 (Reuters) - Ebay Inc  beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly sales on Tuesday, as customers spent more in the holiday shopping season and a multi-year effort to make its platform more user friendly yielded results.
The company reported sales of $2.88 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, up 6.3 percent from a year earlier and slightly higher than analysts' average expectation of $2.86 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net income from continuing operations was $763 million or 80 cents per share, compared with a loss of $2.6 billion or $2.51 per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a one-time tax-related expense of more than $3 billion.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHow much bad news can a publicly traded company absorb before it's baked into the share price? For me, that's the number one question that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) must answer. Ahead of its first-quarter 2019 earnings report, Apple stock has enjoyed a burst of optimism. However, can this rally sustain itself after the financial disclosure?makeArticleAd();On the surface, the iconic consumer-electronics firm enjoys many tailwinds. Despite some recent troubles, its flagship product, the iPhone, still maintains significant influence. In addition, after selling more than one billion iPhones worldwide, Apple's services division should have ample revenue-generating opportunities. This presents an obvious boost for AAPL stock.Moreover, the company has a long, proven track record from coming back from behind. Most recently, Apple stock slipped over a one-year period between the summer seasons of 2015 and 2016. However, that proved to be a ridiculously awesome buying opportunity.Adding to the speculative enthusiasm, AAPL stock lost roughly 30% during the aforementioned period. In contrast, shares lost the same amount in the final quarter of 2018. Plus, as The Wall Street Journal implies, the bar is now set very low for the company. All management must do is not disclose completely terrible numbers.Unfortunately, the markets may not make things that easy for Apple stock. In a rare act of concession, the leadership team earlier this month warned about revenue shortfalls. While shocking, the announcement wasn't really surprising: the company has endured troubles generating interest with their latest iPhone releases.7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019Now, we're seeing just how devastating the U.S.-China trade war has been on the electronics giant. Research firm Strategy Analytics disclosed that iPhone shipments to China dropped 22% in Q4 . With such a steep decline, should investors gamble on the upcoming AAPL earnings report?Apple Stock Has Nowhere to HideMarketWatch reporter Emily Bary bluntly stated that the AAPL earnings for Q4 ""could be the first chapter in an increasingly boring story ."" Not only do I agree, I'll go a step further: this is perhaps the first time that key profitability and growth metrics don't matter for Apple stock.Let me explain. Based on management's deer-in-the-headlights look when they essentially admitted defeat, we know the numbers will disappoint badly. Analysts adjusted down the consensus earnings per share target to $4.17 from $4.66. For revenue, the forecast dropped to $84.6 billion from $89 billion to $93 billion.Even if the embattled company beat both estimates, it likely won't move the needle for AAPL stock. Why? Because the iPhone implosion was never about China. They just happened to represent a convenient scapegoat. No, the real problem is that Apple doesn't have any great ideas.About a year-and-a-half ago, I warned that the company must contend with ""peak smartphone."" Admittedly, Apple stock jumped higher shortly after I wrote that piece. Interestingly, though, shares have now fallen near the point of the publication date.This tells me that fundamentally, AAPL stock went way ahead of itself. Valuations kept rising without management addressing their future strategy. So in light of multiple data points indicating peak smartphone, what did Apple do? They released another smartphone.At the very least, they should have introduced a compelling iPhone. But here again, they failed. What makes this failure dangerous is that it opens the door to the competition.For instance, Sony (NYSE: SNE ) could never compete with Apple in the Steve Jobs era. Today, they've launched a fresh take on the tired smartphone platform. While they're pressuring the iPhone, Sony can simultaneously attack a weakened Apple through its massive content umbrella .AAPL Earnings Needs a GamechangerI'm not sure if Apple's leadership team can do anything to generate positive momentum from the AAPL earnings report. If there's any hope, they've got to introduce a game-changing idea.Of course, the problem is that they have produced few convincing successes outside the iPhone. Most notably, their venture into the smart-speaker industry didn't go over so well. Both Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG , NASDAQ: GOOGL ) remain the sector's top dogs. Other products, such as the iPad, have largely faded from importance .True, Apple can move into the original-content space, to which they made some rumblings last year. However, such a move is doubly problematic. First, they're well behind the curve against their rivals. Second, the low-hanging fruit is gone. The arena has become increasingly competitive and consolidated.Ultimately, the iPhone fallout has exposed how vulnerable Apple stock is. Without their starting quarterback, they better have someone that can come off the bench firing on all cylinders. Otherwise, it's going to be a long year.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto was long SNE.More From InvestorPlace2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid7 Recession-Proof Stocks to Buy ...

307,"January 29, 2019, 09:19:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,3 Retail-Apparel & Shoes Stocks to Pick This Earnings Season,"
 The Retail - Apparel & Shoes  industry is directly correlated to the purchasing power of consumers. Notably, strong job additions and record-low unemployment along with rise in wages are forming a perfect base for higher consumer spending, one of the pivotal factors driving the economy. An uptick in spending is always welcome news for the industry participants.  makeArticleAd();  The industry has certainly undergone a sea change to cope with the altering retail landscape shaped by changing consumer spending habits, lower traffic in brick-and-mortar stores due to rise in online shopping thanks to Amazon AMZN  , and stiff competition from off-price retailers.    In line with this, companies have adopted transformation initiatives revolving around products, stores and marketing. Apart from these, they are also focusing on upgrade of core technology platforms and enhancement of supply chain. Not to forget, players in the industry have to keep up with the fast-changing fashion trends and offer a better bargain. These efforts should boost revenues of the industry constituents.    However, with companies trying all means to gain market share, costs associated with promotional activities and an aggressive pricing strategy have been eating into margins. Further, any deleverage in SG&A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses are bottlenecks.    Nonetheless, the Retail - Apparel & Shoes industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #42 that places it in the top 17% of more than 250 Zacks industries.

308,"January 29, 2019, 08:50:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Amazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why,"
 Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task. That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss. However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores  system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects. Amazon (AMZN) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank. Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better. While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this online retailer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:  Earnings Growth  Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digi t earnings  growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 101%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 35.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 18.3%.  Cash Flow Growth  While cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds. Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Amazon is 30.8%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -0.1%. While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 43.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 20.6%.  Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions  Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. The current-year earnings estimates for Amazon have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.6% over the past month.  Bottom Line  While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Amazon a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here  . This combination positions Amazon well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe latest talk on the Street is that consumer electronics giant Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) - which has been rattled by slowing iPhone growth recently - is looking to make a move in the mobile gaming sector. Specifically, five people familiar with the matter told Cheddar that Apple is planning to a launch a video game subscription service soon.makeArticleAd();Although Apple stock didn't really budge on the news, investors should be aware that this is big news. Apple is in desperate need of innovation and service expansion to compensate for what is stalling out iPhone growth. The problem is that Apple is so big ($260 billion in revenues projected this year) that even a $5 billion expansion business hardly moves the needle for Apple stock.That isn't the case with mobile gaming.If Apple were to successfully create the  Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) of video games for phones, tablets, and computers, this is a potentially $40 billion-plus business opportunity by 2025. It could also add well over $10 billion in operating profits.Numbers like that make mobile gaming more than just a needle mover for Apple stock. A subscription mobile gaming service could be the next big catalyst for Apple stock which recharges growth and takes investors minds off of peak iPhone sales.7 Stocks That Could Double in 2019As such, not only is this an opportunity Apple should 100% pursue, but it's also something that investors should monitor closely. If Apple does announce official intentions to launch such a service, that would be a signal to start getting more bullish on Apple stock.Mobile Gaming Could Be The Next Big ThingHere's the thing that people are starting to figure out about monetizing digital consumers: if you make a subscription service and package a bunch of good stuff into that subscription service, then you can optimally and consistently monetize tens and even hundreds of millions of digital consumers.Think Amazon Prime. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) just bundled all of its commerce and entertainment perks into one subscription that now over 100 million U.S. households pay for every month. Or think Netflix. They just bundled all the content they could gather into one subscription that now nearly 150 million households around the world pay for every month. Spotify (NASDAQ: SPOT ). Hulu . Disney's (NYSE: DIS ) ESPN+ or Disney+ . Same story.This subscription model has, time and time again, successfully worked in monetizing digital consumers. At the current moment, it's largely unproven in the video game industry. But, that's mostly because companies haven't figured out a way to stream games over the cloud. It's a tall order, and much more complex than streaming movies and TV shows.That's all changing now. Technology has improved to a point where the biggest video game publishers, like Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA ), are making big pushes into cloud gaming. As such, it's only a matter of time before subscription services forever change the way consumers pay for video games.Apple is in a prime position to make this pivot on the non-console side of this market (smartphones, tablets, and PCs). Across its ecosystem of products, Apple controls 7% of the PC market, 22% of the smartphone market, and 72% of the tablet market. Thus, millions of consumers are already playing mobile and PC video games through the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers, meaning that launching an Apple mobile video game subscription service is just a few steps away from what's already happening today.If Apple does follow through on these plans, the company could one day be running a $40 billion-plus video game subscription business.This Is a $40 Billion-Plus Opportunity for Apple StockMost growth initiatives don't move the needle for Apple stock. That isn't the case with a potential video game subscription service.According to Newzoo , the global games market measured in at $135 billion revenues in 2018. Only $38 billion was from the console market. Thus, the global smartphone, tablet, and PC games market had revenues of nearly $100 billion last year. Moreover, the smartphone gaming market grew by 14% last year. The tablet gaming market grew by 8%. And the PC market grew by 3%.
 Click to Enlarge  Thus, this is a $100 billion and still steadily growing market.By 2025, I predict that more widespread adoption of smartphones, tablets and PC games, coupled with deeper nonconsole gaming engagement, will push this market to nearly $170 billion in revenues.To be sure, Apple won't control this entire market. But, Apple does control 7% of the PC market, 22% of the smartphone market, and 72% of the tablet market. Breaking down each category and calculating Apple's opportunity, I conclude that an Apple smartphone, tablet and PC video game streaming business could reasonably have around $40 billion in revenues by 2025.This business will likely run at Netflix-like margins. I've long stated that the long-term goal for Netflix operating margins should be 30%. Same is true with an Apple game streaming business. A 30% operating margin on $40 billion in revenues implies an operating profit opportunity of $12 billion.
 Click to Enlarge  Those numbers are big enough to move the needle for Apple stock. Apple is projected to do about $260 billion in revenues this year, and did around $70 billion in operating profits last year. Thus, an Apple game streaming service could reasonably boost revenues and profits by 15% over the next several years.For Apple stock, which is trading at just 12X forward earnings, that's a big move.Bottom Line on AAPLAt this point in time, an Apple game streaming service is just a rumor. But if at any point in the future it becomes more than a rumor, that will be the time to get a little bit more bullish on Apple stock.A potential video game streaming service is the exact catalyst that could ""wake up"" Apple stock, and push the stock back to all time highs.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AAPL, AMZN, SPOT, and EA. More From InvestorPlace2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid7 Stocks to Buy With High ESG Momentum7 Chinese Stocks to Buy Now5 Dow Jones Stocks Under PressureCompare BrokersThe post Could Mobile Gaming Be the Next Big Catalyst for Apple Stock? appeared first on InvestorPlace .

313,"January 29, 2019, 07:00:15 AM EDT",AMZN,InvestorPlace Media,3 Reasons to Consider Buying Amazon Stock Now,"
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsShares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) have definitely had a solid rally off the lows, but does that mean investors missed their chance to go long? Indeed, Amazon stock is up about 27% from its lows, but, keep in mind, it's still down almost 20% from its highs.makeArticleAd(); Source: Shutterstock 

Some investors will say that means we've already missed a bulk of the rebound and that investors should consider taking profits or, at the very least, staying on the sidelines. I'm not saying that we should go all-in right here, right now. But keep in mind: it wasn't all that long ago that investors would have killed to get in below $1,700.Now, they have another chance. Let's look at a few reasons investors should consider a long Amazon stock position.GrowthOf course, one of the top reasons to consider buying Amazon is its growth. Thanks to its industry-leading cloud business, Amazon Web Services, the company has robust top- and bottom-line growth.The company will report earnings on Jan. 31. For the full year, analysts are expecting earnings per share of $19.85 on revenue of $232.36 billion. If achieved, it will represent growth of 335% and 30.6%, respectively. For 2019, estimates call for another 36% earnings growth and 20% sales growth.While that certainly represents a year-over-year deceleration in the growth rate (although not a decline overall), it's still pretty impressive numbers for a company that has a long runaway ahead of it - particularly for a company of this size, at $810 billion.While Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and  Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL , NASDAQ: GOOG ) all have more attractive valuations, Amazon stock has never been cheap on an earnings basis. Not that that's a reason to buy necessarily, but the stock's ten-year return of 3,160% shows that it hasn't hindered its performance.Amazon's BusinessesThe second reason to consider owning Amazon stock is the company's vast moat. Its Prime membership - with two-day shipping (or better), cloud storage, music and more - is a huge generator of cash flow. Its Whole Foods acquisition was a profitable entity when purchased and allows Amazon an entry into one of retail's biggest footprints with grocery.Its online business remains robust and let's be honest: e-commerce isn't going anywhere. That bodes well for Amazon in both the short and the long term.Finally, Amazon's advertising business and cloud-computing business offer plenty of growth opportunity over the next few years and beyond. This gives investors confidence that the growth can continue, particularly with the other business segments Amazon has brewing.Trading Amazon Stock
 Click to EnlargeFinally, the Amazon stock chart is a third catalyst to consider getting long. As we mentioned, shares are still well off the highs and while $2,050 a share is likely a ways away, getting in more than 20% below that price is an opportunity.Admittedly, AMZN is sitting just below some notable resistance between $1,700 and $1,750. Additionally, the stock is technically trending lower. That said, shares are consolidating nicely above the 21-day and 50-day moving averages. Further, there is some decent support near $1,450 - even if AMZN stock overshot this level in December.10 of the Best Stocks to Invest In for FebruaryWith that in mind, investors who are looking at AMZN stock can justify taking a small position now. They can then add to the stock on a further decline.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell .

314,"January 29, 2019, 07:00:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Could This Technology Make Amazon Go Stores Obsolete?,"
  Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) is revolutionizing how we shop with its   cashierless Amazon Go convenience stores, and hopes to expand the   concept from fewer than 10 now into a network of 3,000 stores in   only two years. There may be logistical issues in building out so many stores   in such a short time, as well as political ones if states decide   all stores must accept cash.     But the biggest challenge may be competing technology that   allows more retailers to offer their own no-cashier, no-checkout   shopping. It could make the Amazon Go chain obsolete.   Image source: Amazon.com.makeArticleAd();  The dawn of smart carts Amazon Go's ""just walk out"" shopping experience requires a   store to be outfitted with machine vision, deep-learning   algorithms, and an array of cameras and sensors to watch a   customer's every move. It knows what every item is, and when it's   been picked up and put back, so it can charge a shopper's   account. A start-up called Caper is offering similar technology   that is more accessible to more retailers. Rather than outfit an entire store with such advanced   artificial intelligence (AI), Caper puts it into individual   shopping carts. It lets supermarkets more easily compete   against Amazon without the massive cost necessary to build new   stores or retrofit a chain's existing infrastructure. Shoppers put items into AI-powered carts, which identify the   products and ring up the total. Interactive screens on the carts   not only keep a running tally of the order, but can also direct   shoppers to in-store specials. The technology used by Caper's partners does currently require   customers to scan each item into the shopping cart screens, but   they're using it to train the deep learning algorithm to enable   shopping without scanning. When they are finished shopping, customers can pay via the   screen and leave. While bagging up a week's worth of groceries   could slow you down, this system seems likely to encourage   shoppers to bring their own bags into the store and fill them up   as they go. That's often how the scan-and-go technologies work so   you're not stuck at the register still having to bag all your   items.     Amazon Go's limitations The original Amazon Go location was only 1,800 square feet,   about the size of a convenience store, but it was estimated to   cost at least $1 million to install all the cameras and sensors.   Analysts estimate that to build out 3,000 stores would cost some   $3 billion. While Amazon is testing a range of store sizes, some as large   as 2,400 square feet, it's clear the concept is prohibitively   expensive to apply to something on the order of a full-sized   supermarket and is why they're mostly stocked with convenience   items that you can literally grab-and-go. A   Walmart    store can run anywhere from 30,000 square feet to over 200,000   for one of its supercenters. Even Amazon's Whole Foods Markets   average 40,000 square feet. Retrofitting one of these locations   would also seem to be nearly impossible since all-new shelving   and displays would be needed to incorporate the cameras and   sensors. Many grocery chains like   Kroger    have added so-called scan-and-go capabilities, where customers   use a scanning gun or their smartphones to scan in each item they   buy, and then upload the data to a register at checkout. But it's   a clunkier system than Amazon's effortless grab-and-go   technology; Walmart killed off its own scan-and-go system because   it said shoppers weren't using it. Scaling up artificial intelligence Caper says its cart technology is currently in place at two   grocery store chains, with plans to roll it out to 150 more this   year. The company's website lists six retail partners from the   New York area including C-Town, Key Food, and Pioneer   supermarkets. It says its shopping carts have increased the value   of the average basket by 18% because customers are exposed to   products they might otherwise miss or can't find. Amazon Go is certainly poised to upend the convenience store   industry with its advanced AI wizardry. But Caper could   revolutionize the much broader and larger supermarket sector and   make Amazon's stores obsolete by bringing the same sort of   technology to your neighborhood grocery store in a package that's   far more scalable.   10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

316,"January 29, 2019, 06:44:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Is iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF (CRBN) a Strong ETF Right Now?,"
 A smart beta exchange traded fund, the iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF (CRBN) debuted on 12/08/2014, and offers broad exposure to the World ETFs category of the market.  What Are Smart Beta ETFs?  Market cap weighted indexes were created to reflect the market, or a specific segment of the market, and the ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on this strategy. Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency. But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market. By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such. Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.  Fund Sponsor & Index  Managed by Blackrock, CRBN has amassed assets over $379.29 M, making it one of the larger ETFs in the World ETFs. Before fees and expenses, CRBN seeks to match the performance of the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index. The MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index is designed to address two dimensions of carbon exposure ? carbon emissions and potential carbon emissions from fossil fuel reserves.  Cost & Other Expenses  Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same. Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.20% for CRBN, making it one of the least expensive products in the space. It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 2.35%.  Sector Exposure and Top Holdings  Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. When you look at individual holdings, Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounts for about 1.84% of the fund's total assets, followed by Apple Inc (AAPL) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN). CRBN's top 10 holdings account for about 10.59% of its total assets under management.  Performance and Risk  Year-to-date, the iShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF return is roughly 6.67% so far, and is down about -10.66% over the last 12 months (as of 01/29/2019). CRBN has traded between $99 and $123.81 in this past 52-week period. CRBN has a beta of 0.96 and standard deviation of 12.34% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a low risk choice in the space. With about 1302 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.  Alternatives  IShares MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market.

Jan 29 (Reuters) - GameStop Corp, the world's largest video game and gaming console retailer, said it had abandoned efforts to sell itself after failing to get a potential buyer on favorable terms, sending shares down 21 percent in early trading.
The company said it had held discussions with other firms, but did not get financing on terms that would be commercially acceptable to a prospective acquirer. 
Shares of the company surged 16 percent in September, when media reports said GameStop hired Perella Weinburg to explore a sale. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
GameStop sold its Spring Mobile business to Prime Communications LP for $700 million in November. 
The company's board is still looking for a permanent chief executive officer, it said.
In May, CEO Michael Mauler stepped down from his post after only three months on the job, citing personal reasons. In June, the company brought on board former Microsoft Xbox executive and board director Shane Kim as interim CEO.

By Marc Jones
LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Gold climbed to a seven-month high on Tuesday as markets opted for caution before three major macro events and a blizzard of big tech company earnings in the coming days, starting with Apple later.
Despite the upcoming action - a key Brexit vote in the UK, Wednesday's U.S. Federal Reserve decision and Thursday's conclusion of the latest Sino-U.S. trade talks - European and Asian stocks held up relatively well.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
News that the U.S had levelled charges against China's telecom giant Huawei [RIC:RIC:HWT.UL] days before the next round of trade talks between Washington and Beijing knocked sentiment. 
But it was offset by promises of more economic stimulus from China, which had berated Washington on Monday for blocking the appointment of judges for its World Trade Organisation appeal against U.S. tariffs. 
Amid the turmoil, gold  broke through $1,300 an ounce to reach its highest since mid June. 
""Investors are very cautious with many uncertainties on U.S.-China trade talks and Brexit. Huawei is at the centre of dispute, creating very noisy background for the trade talks,"" said Margaret Yang, a market analyst at CMC Markets.
""All these are making it more difficult for investors to judge the market's direction. Money is fleeing into assets such as gold, seeking safety."" ,""
The U.S.-Sino moves, as well as bets that the U.S. Fed will sound more cautious on Wednesday, kept the dollar near a two-week low and heightened the safe-haven appeal of the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. 
Sterling  held at $1.3166 and 86.88 pence to the euro before crucial votes later in the day aimed at breaking a deadlock in the UK parliament over Brexit .
The pound has rallied 6 percent from Jan. 4 lows, but further gains may be limited unless lawmakers emerge with a big majority on the votes. 
Most European government bond yields were little changed. Weaker economic data and unknowns like the trade feuds and Brexit have all boosted expectations that interest rates will stay low.
New debt deals from Greece, Belgium and Austria were also in the pipeline. The slide in rates has also encouraged governments to launch new bond deals. Even Angola, which has just taken IMF aid, said it was eyeing a bond sale. 
In Asia, shares were mixed, with losses for Australia and New Zealand, with their benchmark indices  down 0.5 percent and 1.2 percent respectively. Japanese and Chinese stocks both recovered from early wobbles to finish in the green.,, 


WARNING BELLS
Markets will have more catalysts this week with over 100 of the S&P500 companies reporting results, including Amazon, Apple  and Facebook.
Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow  and S&P 500  each closed down 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq  was off more than 1 percent.
The losses came after Caterpillar  and Nvidia Corp  joined a growing list of companies cautioning about the crippling effects of softening Chinese demand. 
""Both companies are seen as industry bellwethers, and their disappointing results provide further evidence that this time China's slowdown is for real,"" said Rodrigo Catril, Sydney-based strategist at National Australia Bank.
Worryingly, earnings at China's industrial firms too shrank in December, pointing to more troubles for the country's vast manufacturing sector, which are already struggling with a decline in orders, job layoffs and factory closures. 
Oil recovered after overnight losses. U.S. crude  was last up 35 cents at $52.34 a barrel; Brent  gained 37 cents to $60.30.
Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA on Monday, a step that is likely to curb its crude exports to the U.S. and ratchet up the pressure on President Nicolas Maduro.

@media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}



By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc's  online retailer Flipkart has told the Indian government the company faces the risk of ""significant customer disruption"" if the implementation of new curbs for e-commerce is not delayed by six months, a source told Reuters.
India's new foreign investment restrictions will, from Feb. 1, bar e-commerce companies from selling products from firms in which they have an equity interest and also ban them from reaching deals with sellers to only sell on one platform. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
""Redesigning numerous elements of our technology systems to ensure that we can validate and evidence our compliance, in such a compressed period of time, has caused us to divert significant resources,"" Krishnamurthy wrote in the letter. The new curbs were only announced on Dec. 26.
He also said the regulations could cause ""significant customer disruption"" if the deadline for compliance wasn't extended. He asked for a six-month delay.
The contents of Flipkart's letter have not been previously reported. Flipkart declined to comment.
Indian officials have said the government is unlikely to change the policy's implementation date. The industries department declined to comment for this article.
The policy move has jolted Walmart, which last year invested $16 billion in Flipkart in its biggest ever deal, and Amazon, which has committed $5.5 billion in India investments.
Industry sources have said the new policy would raise compliance costs and force Amazon and Flipkart to review their business arrangements in the country.
Flipkart and Amazon have both started working on approaching thousands of sellers on their platforms to ensure the companies comply with the regulations, three sources aware of the matter said, even as they seek a deadline extension.
For Flipkart, the process would take five-to-six months, said one of the sources, who told Reuters: ""the company is right now focusing on working with sellers (for compliance), all rest is on the back burner"".


UNFAIR MARKETPLACE?
India's small traders had complained that large e-commerce companies used their control over inventory from their affiliates to create an unfair marketplace that allowed them to offer deep discounts on some products. Such arrangements would be barred under the new policy.
Amazon told Reuters last week it had written to the Indian government to seek an extension of four months. With more than 400,000 sellers and ""hundreds of thousands of transactions"" daily, Amazon said it needed the time to understand the policy.
Flipkart, in its letter, said the group has more than 80,000 employees and contractors and the number of shipments and packages which move daily were between 500,000 and 600,000.
The new policy ""imposes several new conditions, which we believe could potentially have undesirable impacts on the continued growth of e-commerce in India"", Krishnamurthy wrote.
The company added that it wanted to work with the federal government to promote ""pro-growth policies"" which can help develop the e-commerce sector. Before the policy change, Morgan Stanley estimated India's e-commerce market would grow 30 percent a year to $200 billion in the 10 years up to 2027.
The U.S. government has been concerned and earlier this month told Indian officials to protect Walmart and Amazon's investments in the country, citing ""good relations"" between the two countries, Reuters reported on Thursday.

By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Asian shares stumbled on Tuesday and the dollar hovered near two-week lows as prospects for a long-awaited Sino-U.S. trade deal were dealt another blow after the United States levelled sweeping criminal charges against China's telecom giant Huawei.
The mood was expected to be subdued elsewhere with spreadbetters suggesting a tentative start for Europe while futures for the S&P 500, Dow  and Nasdaq  were each off 0.2 percent.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Chinese shares opened in the red, then recovered in the afternoon. Shanghai's SSE Composite  was up 0.1 percent while the blue-chip index  climbed 0.4 percent.
Overall, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  was still down 0.2 percent even after recouping some of its earlier losses.
Japan's Nikkei, down about 1 percent almost all day, turned around to end 0.1 percent higher.
Despite the late uptick in share prices, the mood was still gloomy after the U.S. Justice Department unsealed indictments against China's top telecom equipment maker, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, accusing it of bank and wire fraud to evade Iran sanctions and conspiring to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile US Inc.
The jolt threatens to undermine prospects for a trade deal between the economic giants as markets nervously await a round of trade talks with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He set to meet U.S. officials on Wednesday and Thursday. 
Further complicating matters, China triggered the legal process on Monday for the World Trade Organization to hear Beijing's challenge to U.S. tariffs, and berated the United States for blocking the appointment of judges who could rule on it. 
Souring U.S.-China relations roiled global markets for much of last year, and have kept investors on the back foot this month. The trade war's broadening impact on world growth is one reason the U.S. Federal Reserve has signalled it will be patient on policy after raising rates four times in 2018.
Indeed, many economists, including the International Monetary Fund, have cut their forecasts for global growth this year, citing the U.S.-China trade war.
""Slowdown is feeding into some acute areas of economic unease,"" U.S. bank Citi said in a note, citing recent  disappointing factory output data out of Europe and China.
It noted that investors were pricing in a 1 percent contraction in global earnings per share (EPS) this year. ""This would be the worst year-on-year percentage change in EPS since 2015"" even though economic growth is likely to be much higher this year than seen in 2015, the note said.


WARNING BELLS
Markets will have more catalysts this week with over 100 of the S&P500 companies reporting results, including Amazon, Apple  and Facebook.
Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow  and S&P 500  each closed down 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq  was off more than 1 percent.
The losses came as shares of Caterpillar  and Nvidia Corp  nosedived after the two manufacturers joined a growing list of companies cautioning about the crippling effects of softening Chinese demand. 
""Both companies are seen as industry bellwethers and their disappointing results provide further evidence that this time China's slowdown is for real,"" said Rodrigo Catril, Sydney-based strategist at National Australia Bank.
Worryingly, earnings at China's industrial firms too shrank in December, pointing to more troubles for the country's vast manufacturing sector already struggling with a decline in orders, job layoffs and factory closures. 
Slowdown fears slugged the U.S. dollar, which faltered to its lowest in two weeks on Monday. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last at 95.733.
Against the safe haven Japanese yen, the dollar was down at 109.32, on track for a third straight session of losses.
The downbeat global growth impulse mean investors will look for further confirmation the Fed will pause its rate-hike cycle at a two-day policy meeting ending Wednesday.
Elsewhere, sterling  dithered against the dollar ahead of voting in Britain's parliament on Tuesday that aims to break the Brexit deadlock. It was last at $1.3152.
Oil bounced after hefty overnight losses. U.S. crude  was last up 35 cents at $52.34 a barrel while Brent  gained 37 cents to $60.30.
U.S. gold futures  hovered near seven-month highs at $1,302.2 per ounce. Spot gold  was last at 1,304.19 after breaking above a key psychological barrier of $1,300 an ounce on Friday.

323,"January 28, 2019, 08:08:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Has Amazon Really Changed Whole Foods' Image?,"
  Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) won't be opening any more Whole Foods 365 discount   stores. The grocery store chain's CEO, John Mackey, said the   price gap between the value chain and the full-price Whole Foods   Market stores has narrowed enough since Amazon bought the company   that there is no longer a need for two separate chains. Whole lotta nothing Whole Foods has been plagued with a reputation as an   overpriced organic grocer since its beginning, a perception   reflected in the ""Whole Paycheck"" moniker many people give it.   The 365 concept was opened to counter that perception, and   focused on Whole Foods' private-label brand, which sometimes   carried items priced lower than you could find at   Walmart    . There are a dozen 365 stores now.   Image source: Whole Foods Market.makeArticleAd();  When Amazon bought the supermarket, it put up for sale on its   online grocery platform thousands of 365 goods,   most of which sold out    almost immediately. Subsequent surveys, however, found the price   discounts offered by Amazon for Whole Foods goods were fleeting   at best. As recently as last September, market researchers at      Gordon Haskett Research Advisors    found that although consumers expected Amazon to cut Whole Foods   prices by an average of 15%, a basket of 108 items that would   have cost $409.37 on Aug. 17, 2017 -- the day Amazon's   acquisition of Whole Foods closed -- cost $407.83 one year later,   a savings of just $1.54. As the report noted, ""But to save the   $1.54, customer had to fork over the $119 annual Prime membership   fee."" Though many of them may already have had a Prime   membership, as the company says there are more than 100 million   Prime members. Prime beneficiary Yet Amazon has rolled out a number of benefits to its Prime   members who shop at Whole Foods. Members get an additional 10%   off hundreds of sale items in the store, as well as exclusive   access to weekly deals. Amazon has also expanded to eight the number of cities where,   through its Prime Now service, customers can enjoy one-hour   pickup of the groceries they purchased from Whole Foods. There is   also one-hour delivery for Prime Now customers in 63 cities, and   customers can also receive 5% back on Whole Foods purchases if   they shop using Amazon's Prime Rewards Visa Card, all of   which has helped Amazon   own the online grocery    market. So Whole Foods shoppers do receive several benefits from   Amazon's ownership, and though most consumers have to pay for a   Prime membership to receive them, they're also getting a lot of   other benefits included in their Prime membership, such as free   shipping and streaming videos and music. The Whole Foods   discounts are an added perk, and Amazon is expanding the   number of Whole Foods stores across the country. One step back, two steps forward But the answer to the question of whether Amazon has convinced   consumers Whole Foods is no longer Whole Paycheck would seem to   be a no. A Yahoo! Finance survey last August found that   while half of the 2,000 people it queried thought Amazon had   brought positive change to Whole Foods, 40% believed Whole Foods   prices weren't any lower. That may not be much of an impediment as Amazon can still   win over consumers by adding more value.

By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Even as India's new e-commerce curbs sting global giants Amazon.com Inc  and Walmart-owned Flipkart, their local rival Snapdeal is cheering the move.
India will from Feb. 1 impose restrictions on how e-commerce firms operate, including barring them from selling products from firms in which they have an equity interest, leading to protests from Amazon and Flipkart. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
It did not name any companies in its letter, but said ""the loud protests"" by some firms was an ""indication of how effective this regulation"" will be.
The government's move has jeopardised Amazon and Flipkart's plans to tap the fast-growing e-commerce market as it would require them to rethink their existing business structures and raise compliance costs, industry sources have said.
The rules came after India's small traders complained that online retailers used their control over inventory from their affiliates to create an unfair marketplace that allowed them to sell some products at lower prices. Such arrangements would be barred under the new policy.
""The timelines allowed are adequate for compliance,"" Snapdeal's Chief Executive Kunal Bahl wrote in a letter to India's commerce minister, which was seen by Reuters.
The company said it had updated its technological processes and expects to comply and go through a ""smooth transition"" on Feb. 1.
In contrast, Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart have sought an extension of the deadline, saying they need more time to understand and implement the policy.
Government sources have told Reuters India is unlikely to agree to those demands as Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs supports of small traders in the general election, which is due by May.
Following the policy announcement in December, the United States government asked officials in New Delhi to protect investments in Amazon and Walmart given the ""good relations"" between the two countries, Reuters reported on Thursday. 
""Every nation has a right to frame policies that best suit its economic and social needs,"" Snapdeal said in its letter.
Amazon has committed to investing $5.5 billion in India, while Walmart  last year spent $16 billion to acquire Flipkart, as more and more Indians go online to shop.
Morgan Stanley had estimated, before the latest government move, that India's e-commerce market would grow 30 percent a year to $200 billion in the 10 years up to 2027.

325,"January 28, 2019, 05:47:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Here's What to Expect From eBay's Q4 Earnings Results Tuesday,"
 Shares of eBay EBAY  popped 0.89% during regular trading hours Monday, one day before it is set to report its fourth quarter financial results. So, let's see what investors should expect from the e-commerce giant's earnings Tuesday.  Overview  Today, roughly 10% of eBay's items are sold via auction and less than 20% of items are second-hand. This might come as a bit of a surprise to some since eBay rose to prominence as an auctioned-based website to buy used goods. The company also announced last year that it will stop using PayPal PYPL  , which it spun off in 2015, as its back-end payments service after 2020. EBay is set to transition to its new Adyen-based payment system-the firm boasts clients such as Uber, Spotify SPOT  , and Microsoft MSFT  . Investors should note that activist shareholder Elliott Management, which owns more than 4% of eBay stock, last week said that eBay should think about moving on from StubHub and its portfolio of Classifieds properties. ""In addition to unlocking substantial value, separating these assets would allow eBay's management team to refocus its efforts solely on the core Marketplace business,"" the firm wrote in a letter  to eBay. EBay said  it will ""carefully review and evaluate Elliott's proposals."" And the firm might seriously consider Elliott's suggestion since eBay stock has clearly performed far worse than the e-commerce industry average over the last two years. This group obviously includes giants Amazon AMZN  and Alibaba BABA  , but shares of eBay are down roughly 17% over the last year despite its massive post-Christmas rally.         Q4 Outlook  Moving on, eBay's Q4 revenues are projected to jump 9.73% to reach $2.87 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. This would come in above last quarter's 6% climb. At the same time, eBay's gross merchandise volume is projected to pop 3.7% to reach $25.317 billion, based on our NFM estimates, which would fall short of Q3's 5% GMV expansion.  Meanwhile, eBay's active buyer base is expected to reach 178.18 million in Q4. This would mark a 1.18 million sequential jump and a 4.8% climb from the year-ago period-Q3's active buyer base popped 4%. At the bottom end of the income statement, eBay's adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to jump 15.25% to reach $0.68 per share. Investors should note that this estimate would come in below Q3's 19% EPS growth.  Bottom Line  EBay is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) based mostly on its recen t earnings  estimate revision activity. The e-commerce firm is expected to release its Q4 financial results after the closing bell Tuesday, so make sure to come back to Zacks for a full breakdown.

 It was just a decade ago that   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) made it possible to stream movies and episodes of   your favorite television programs over the internet. Since then,   a host of imitators have followed suit, changing the media   landscape forever. Some of the old guard has been slower to   accept the shifting paradigm, and it wasn't until 2017 that   streaming services got their first serious Academy Award   consideration. Netflix won best documentary short for   White Helmets    , but it was   Amazon    's (NASDAQ: AMZN)    Manchester By the Sea    that   stole the show    , picking up two Oscars -- best actor for Casey Affleck and best   original screenplay for director Kenneth Lonergan. Many believed   that Netflix's policy of releasing films for streaming on the   same day they debuted in theaters left Oscar voters cold. Revising that strategy appears to have paid off big, as   Roma    led the field with 10 Academy Award nominations (tied with   The Favourite    ).     makeArticleAd();   Netflix original movie Roma captured 10 Academy Award     nominations. Image source: Netflix.  A change of heart After years of sticking to its guns, Netflix relented this   year, giving   several of its high-profile films    exclusive theatrical runs before they debuted on its streaming   service. This move paid off for a couple of Netflix original   movies, but none more so than   Roma    . The movie, which is drawn from memories of director Alfonso   Cuaron's childhood, was nominated for best picture. Cuaron also   made history by being the first director to be nominated for both   best director and best cinematography for the same picture. The   movie also received nods for best screenplay and best foreign   language film, among others. That wasn't the only Netflix movie that was shown in theaters   to receive nominations. The Coen brothers' Western anthology   The Ballad of Buster Scruggs    earned several nominations, including best-adapted screenplay and   best original song.  GOOD MORNING, BEAUTIFUL WORLD.        I'm very excited to share that ROMA has been nominated for 10   Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director-   @AlfonsoCuaron    , Best Actress-   @YalitzaAparicio    , Best Supporting Actress-   @MarDeTavira    , and Best Original Screenplay!      pic.twitter.com/cHPJYBQq7o     - Netflix Film (@NetflixFilm)   January 22, 2019    A growing spotlight Netflix's original movie programming has been making headlines   recently. Netflix won five Golden Globes earlier this month, more   than any other network, studio, or streaming service -- winning   statues for both its television series and films.   Roma    took top honors for best director and best foreign language film.   The Kominsky Method     also won two awards -- best musical or comedy series and   best actor in a musical or comedy series for Michael Douglas.   Richard Madden won best actor in a drama series for   The Bodyguard    . It isn't just the awards circuit that has been getting a lot   of attention for Netflix.   Bird Box    , which also had a brief stint in theaters, became the   most watched movie    in Netflix's history, according to the company. In a tweet in   late December, the company said the post-apocalyptic thriller was   watched by more than 45 million accounts -- the ""best first seven   days ever for a Netflix film."" In its   recent earnings report    , the company went even further, saying that 80 million member   households -- or 57% of its worldwide subscriber base -- watched   the movie in its first four weeks of release. The film also went viral after viewers began wearing   blindfolds to complete everyday tasks, a nod to the premise of   the film. That prompted Netflix to   tweet the following warning    :  Can't believe I have to say this, but: PLEASE DO NOT HURT   YOURSELVES WITH THIS BIRD BOX CHALLENGE. We don't know how this   started, and we appreciate the love, but Boy and Girl have just   one wish for 2019 and it is that you not end up in the hospital   due to memes.    - Netflix US (@netflix)   January 2, 2019    There's no such thing as bad publicity Taken together, the events discussed above illustrate how   Netflix is raising its public profile among potential   subscribers. Its recent Golden Globe wins, the massive viewership   of   Bird Box    (no doubt helped by the viral nature of the #BirdBoxChallenge),   and its field-leading 10 Academy Award nominations for   Roma    show how the company is capturing the public zeitgeist and   attracting the subscribers of tomorrow.   10 stocks we like better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

344,"January 28, 2019, 07:11:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Can eBay Deliver When It Reports Earnings?,"
 Last year was a tough one for   eBay    (NASDAQ: EBAY) investors. The e-commerce platform lost a quarter   of its value as the broader digital shopping market grew up   around it, dwarfed by the success of major players like   Amazon    . In the wake of these events, eBay has worked to remake itself,   targeting more of a niche market. Investor enthusiasm coupled with recent events have pushed   eBay's stock up more than 16% in recent weeks, putting pressure   on the company to continue to deliver. eBay is scheduled to release the financial results of its   just-completed fourth quarter after the market close on Tuesday,   Jan. 29. Let's take a look at the company's third-quarter   earnings, a news flash, and eBay's outlook to see what insight   they provide into the company's upcoming earnings report.makeArticleAd();   Image source: eBay.  A look back In   the third quarter    , eBay generated revenue of $2.65 billion, an increase of 6% year   over year, falling at the low end of the company's guidance and   just missing analyst consensus estimates of $2.66 billion.   Diluted earnings per share of $0.73 climbed 52% compared to the   prior-year quarter. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 19% year   over year to $0.56, at the high end of management's forecast and   edging past expectations of $0.55 per share. eBay reported that global active buyers grew to 177 million,   up 4% compared to the prior-year quarter. Marketplace revenue of   $2.1 billion climbed 6%, while StubHub revenue of $291 million   increased 7%, both year over year. Gross merchandise volume (GMV)   for marketplace and StubHub grew to $21.5 billion and $1.2   billion, respectively. Total GMV of $22.7 billion grew 5% year   over year. eBay's classified ads business added revenue of $254   million, up 8% year over year. Current events Activist investment firm Elliot Management released an open   letter to eBay's management, after   disclosing a 4% stake    in the online marketplace, making it one of the company's largest   investors. The letter said Elliot's $1.4 billion investment in   the company ""demonstrates our strong belief in the value   opportunity at eBay."" Elliot's team pointed out that the stock   had underperformed its peers, and laid out a number of steps it   believes eBay must take to unlock that value. These steps include revitalizing the company's core   marketplace, spinning off StubHub and eBay's classifieds   business, instituting operational improvements, implementing a   1.5% dividend yield, and accelerating its stock buybacks. The   hedge fund believes if eBay were to implement these steps, it   would nearly double eBay's stock price to $63 per share within   two years. eBay has said it's reviewing Elliot's proposals. What the quarter may hold For the upcoming fourth quarter, eBay is guiding for net   revenue in a range of $2.85 billion to $2.89 billion,   representing year-over-year growth of between 4% and 5%,   excluding the impact of foreign currency changes. The company is   also expecting diluted earnings per share (EPS) of between $0.87   and $0.92, and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $0.67   and $0.69. To put this into the context of investor expectations and the   broader market sentiment, analysts' consensus estimates are   calling for revenue of $2.87 billion, in line with management's   guidance, and adjusted EPS of $0.68, at the high end of eBay's   forecast range. It's important to note the high expectations that are already   built into eBay's stock, especially in the wake of Elliot   Management's letter. As of this writing, eBay's shares have   rallied more than 16% in 2019, an indication that investors are   expecting eBay to deliver the goods. If its results fall short,   the stock will likely resume the downward trend it maintained in   2018. We'll know much more when the company reports       after the market closes    on Tuesday, Jan. 29.   10 stocks we like better than eBay       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

  Sirius XM SIRI  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2018 results on Jan 30.  makeArticleAd();  The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and reported in-line earnings in the other two quarters, with the average positive earnings surprise being 9.17%. In the las t report  ed quarter, the company's adjusted earnings of 7 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings and revenues is currently pegged at 6 cents and $1.48 billion, respectively.   Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise        Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  |  Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Quote    Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.   Solid Content, Service Reach to Aid Subscriber Growth    Sirius XM has been witnessing healthy subscriber additions owing to its strong content lineup and expanded service reach.    Notably, the company added 1.4 million self-pay subscribers in 2018, exceeding its earlier guided figure of 1.275 million self-pay net subscribers, per management. Additionally, the company expects to meet or exceed its 2018 guidance for revenues, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.    Apart from music, Sirius XM continues to add content from talk shows, sports and lifestyle to provide diverse offerings to its users. Additionally, with Sirius XM-enabled radio vehicles increasing on the road, we believe the adoption of its other connected services may also increase, which is a positive.    One of the company's connected services for car buyers includes three years of free crash alert as well as free premium services like roadside assistance for six months at a few dealership locations. Notably, over 113 million vehicles on road were equipped with Sirius XM-enabled radios, up 13% year over year in third-quarter 2018.    Moreover, Sirius XM has moved beyond cars to expand its service reach. The company's partnership with Amazon AMZN  to provide free access to a few of its subscription packages for existing Echo holders is expected to boost its subscriber base and engagement levels.    However, other players in the streaming space like Apple and Spotify are also boosting their service offerings to attract users. This may not bode well for Sirius XM.   What Our Model Says    According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP  has a good chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.    Sirius has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

Jan 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open lower onMonday after weak earnings and full-year forecasts fromCaterpillar set a dour note for an earnings-heavy week that alsoincludes a Federal Reserve meeting and U.S.-China trade talks.
Shares of the world's largest heavy equipment maker fell 6.2percent in premarket trading as quarterly profit and full-yearoutlook fell short of analysts' estimates after the companysuffered from a slowdown in construction business in China. urn:newsml:reuters.com:*:nL3N1ZS3QX

""With Caterpillar blaming China, investors are expecting tosee more companies do the same in through the week,"" said PeterCardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securitiesin New York.
""The quality of earnings so far isn't all that negative, butinvestors are clearly focusing more on what a company likeCaterpillar would say.""

Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures dipped on Monday, as weak forecast from Caterpillar added to nerves about Chinese economy, while optimism over the end to the longest U.S. government shutdown in history faded.

As signs of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy become stark, investors are pinning their hopes for a compromise between Washington and Beijing on trade. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will head to the United States on Wednesday and Thursday, for the next round of trade negotiations.
Caterpillar Inc  shares fell 5.5 percent, reversing early premarket gains after the world's largest heavy equipment maker on Monday forecast full-year profit below analysts' estimates, indicating a slide in global demand stemming from China could worsen after the company reported revenue in line with expectations for the last three months of 2018.

352,"January 27, 2019, 06:24:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Walmart Just Dealt Google's Online Shopping Push a Big Blow,"
 Google has seen   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) eat away at its share of   online product searches    over the past few years, and that's bad for   Alphabet    's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) business. Google has been introducing new products and partnerships over   the last few years to make it easier for online shoppers to find   and purchase what they're looking for straight from Google.   Walmart    (NYSE: WMT) was one of its earliest partners for its Google   Express and Google Shopping Actions service. But the big-box   retailer recently pulled out of both products. The move is telling of Walmart's ambitions and success in   growing e-commerce, as well as how valuable (or not so valuable)   Walmart sees Google as a partner.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Walmart.   Why is Walmart dropping Google?  Walmart removed itself from Google Express earlier this month,   the first Google service for the retailer to drop. Google Express   offers fast shipping from a selection of local stores; packages   usually show up in one or two days. Walmart is increasingly focused on fulfilling orders itself   from its own stores. It's utilizing various delivery methods in   order to get items to customers' doorsteps quickly. It's slowly   expanding the number of items eligible for two-day shipping from   its website as it looks to compete with Amazon Prime. Google Express' fast shipping doesn't provide any additional   benefits to Walmart's customers. Moreover, it dilutes Walmart's   customer relationships. A shopper who uses Google Express to buy   stuff from Walmart might not have the same attachment to Walmart   as someone shopping directly with the retailer. On the flip side,   Walmart can capture a lot more data on shoppers who use its   website instead of Google Express and use that data to improve   its online shopping experience over time.  Shopping Actions    , the second service Walmart removed itself from, builds on   Google Express. It makes a retailer's inventory easy to surface   on Google's voice assistant, lets users check out using a   ""universal cart"" that combines items from multiple retailers, and   seamlessly integrates shopper loyalty programs into the checkout   process. Ultimately, it's an advertising product where Google   keeps a share of every sale. Again, Walmart likely pulled back to   take greater control of its e-commerce operations. That said, Walmart's decision also indicates that those   benefits weren't moving the needle much for Walmart. Google's   voice assistant competes against Amazon's Alexa. While smart   speakers and voice assistants can be useful for researching   products, very few people actually make purchases that way. The move might also indicate that Google's efforts in   e-commerce aren't paying off with a greater share of product   searches. Losing Walmart's business certainly won't help in that   regard.  Amazon keeps getting stronger  Google's coalition against Amazon has lost a key member in   Walmart, and that's good news for Amazon. Amazon is gaining   customer loyalty thanks to its growing   two-sided network    of Prime members and third-party merchants. There are now over   100 million Americans    with access to Prime shipping benefits on over 100 million items   on Amazon.com. As more people start their product searches on Amazon, it   encourages more merchants to sell their products on its   marketplace and use its third-party merchants services. That, in   turn, makes more products available for Prime shipping benefits,   making Prime more attractive. And that results in more people   starting their product searches on Amazon. Google is a big loser of that virtuous cycle for Amazon, and   it's largely dependent on other retailers like Walmart to help   combat it. Meanwhile, Walmart is working to attract customers to its own   website, and it's had particular success with online grocery   ordering. The company's shown considerable e-commerce sales   growth thanks to grocery. Online sales grew 43% year over year in   the third quarter, and grocery comparable sales on a two-year   stack were the best in nine years. Walmart is working to   translate more online grocery sales to general e-commerce   sales. For now, Amazon remains the one-stop shop for online shopping.   Neither Google nor Walmart is going to take that away anytime   soon.   10 stocks we like better than Walmart Inc.

353,"January 27, 2019, 05:00:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Amazon.com's $4.5 Billion Retail Opportunity,"
  Amazon.com    's (NASDAQ: AMZN) cashierless Amazon Go convenience stores don't   just replicate productivity rates typically   achieved by elite retailers    like   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) . When the full complement of 3,000 stores that   the e-commerce giant is planning to flood the market with are up   and running, they could be generating returns 50% greater than   the typical convenience store. Data from RBC Capital Markets suggests the average Amazon Go   location can generate $1.5 million in sales annually versus   convenience stores of a similar size, whch generate sales of   about $1 million a year, according to the National Association of   Convenience Stores. Extrapolate those figures to 2021, when all   the Amazon Go stores are planned to be operational, and the   company could be pulling in $4.5 billion a year in sales.   Image source: Amazon.com.makeArticleAd();  The sales won't come cheap, as the technology behind the   original store was estimated to cost $1 million, which would   bring the total tab to $3 billion if Amazon builds them all and   costs stay flat. But they would be sunk costs for Amazon, and   presumably they should decline over time from efficiencies   realized from building out so many locations. In any case, Amazon   has a huge opportunity on its hands. Experiencing heavy traffic RBC Capital Markets based its estimates on actual visits its   analysts made to Amazon Go stores. They figured that based on the   400 to 700 customers a day they counted, who bought approximately   $10 worth of goods per visit, the typical Amazon Go store would   make between $1.1 million to $1.95 million per store per year. If   Amazon builds all 3,000 stores as planned, that's some $4.5   billion a year at the midpoint of that range. There are some caveats. Amazon hasn't decided on what the   actual format of the stores will be. It's currently trying   several different size stores ranging from 1,200 square feet to   around twice that size. The eight stores in operation now also   carry different items. Tech site Recode says some only offer   sandwiches and salads while others sell beer and other packaged   grocery items. The ability to build 3,000 stores may also be thwarted by   Luddite politicians who   demand all stores accept cash    . Massachusetts passed a law several years ago requiring stores   in the state to accept cash, while the New Jersey Legislature   recently introduced a bill requiring the same. The   legislation does carve out some exceptions, including stores in   airports -- some of the places Amazon is considering. That would   suggest those locations would be dramatically smaller than the   existing Go stores and would carry an even more limited   inventory. Also, Amazon's plan for 3,000 stores in two years is highly   ambitious -- it would have to open around 1,500 stores a year, or   four stores a day, every day. There is also competition coming that could affect Amazon Go   stores. 7-Eleven, for example, one of Amazon's primary targets,   is testing a new mobile checkout process in 14 Dallas area   stores. Called Scan & Pay, it lets customers scan an item's   QR code with their smartphones and pay for it using the 7-Eleven   rewards mobile app. It's not as effortless as Amazon Go, but it   is another workable, less costly system that could be applied by   other convenience store chains. The key takeaway Amazon actually hitting $4.5 billion in annual sales from   Amazon Go may simply be a case of analysts drawing a straight   line far into the future. But it's also clear that the e-commerce   giant has identified a problem in the retail experience -- the   choke point of actually paying for goods -- and once again is at   the forefront of changing how we think about shopping. By removing this bottleneck and making the entire shopping   experience less painful, Amazon.com is likely to be richly   rewarded for its efforts no matter how many stores it actually   builds.   10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

354,"January 27, 2019, 03:07:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Has International Business Machines (IBM) Finally Bottomed Out?,"
 Shares of   IBM    (NYSE: IBM) jumped 8% on Jan. 23 after the tech giant's   fourth-quarter numbers beat analyst expectations. Big Blue's   revenue fell 3% annually to $21.8 billion, marking a second   consecutive drop but surpassing estimates by $30 million. Its   non-GAAP net income fell 8% to $4.4 billion and its non-GAAP EPS   declined 6% to $4.87, which still beat expectations by a   nickel. On a GAAP basis, which included tax reform charges in the   fourth quarters of 2017 and 2018, IBM posted a net profit of $2   billion -- compared to a loss of $1.1 billion a year ago.   However, IBM's tax-related charges of $1.9 billion during the   quarter were much lower than the $5.5 billion it paid last   year.   Image source: IBM.makeArticleAd();  IBM expects its non-GAAP EPS to rise at least 0.7% to $13.90,   compared to the consensus forecast for flat growth. That forecast   includes gains from the recent sale of some of its software   assets to   HCL Technologies     and   its acquisition    of   Red Hat    (NYSE: RHT) , which should close in the second half of 2019. It   also expects to generate $12 billion in free cash flow (FCF) for   the full year, compared to $11.9 billion in 2018. On the surface, Big Blue's growth still looks mediocre. Yet   some investors might be wondering if IBM's post-earnings rally   indicates that the stock -- which hit a multiyear low last month   -- is finally ready to climb higher. First, the bad news... IBM's entire turnaround hinges on the growth of its ""strategic   imperatives"" (SI), which include its higher-growth cloud,   analytics, mobile, social, and security products and services.   IBM's SI revenues rose 9% to $39.8 billion over the past 12   months and accounted for half of its top line. Unfortunately,   that still represented a significant slowdown from its   double-digit growth in previous quarters:    Metric Q1 2018 Q2 2018 Q3 2018 Q4 2018   SI revenue                   (trailing 12 months) $37.7 billion $39.0 billion $39.5 billion $39.8 billion   Year-over-year growth 12% 15% 13% 9%    Data source: IBM quarterly reports. IBM's total cloud revenue rose 12% to $19.2 billion over the   past 12 months, while its closely watched cloud services revenue   went up 18% to $12.2 billion. Those growth rates, which also   decelerated over the past year, look dismal compared to   the cloud growth rates of   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) and   Microsoft    (NASDAQ: MSFT) . Amazon's AWS (Amazon Web Services), which competes against   IBM's public cloud platform services, grew its revenues by 48%   annually to $18.2 billion during the first nine months of   2019. Microsoft, which competes against IBM in the public,   private, and hybrid cloud markets, reported that its commercial   cloud revenues rose 47% annually to $8.5 billion in the   first quarter of 2019. Three of IBM's core business units also generated weak growth   during the fourth quarter. Its technology services and cloud   platforms revenue stayed flat on a constant currency basis at   $8.9 billion, reflecting the weakness of its cloud business; its   systems revenue tumbled 20% to $2.6 billion, partly due to   cyclically weak demand for IBM Z mainframe systems; and its   global financing revenue slid 9% to $402 million.   Image source: IBM.  Now, some good news... On the bright side, IBM's cognitive solutions revenue jumped   2% to $5.4 billion on a constant currency basis, which is a   recovery from its   5% drop    in the third quarter. IBM attributed the rebound to stronger   demand for its transaction processing software, analytics and AI   tools, and private cloud services (including Watson and   blockchain). IBM's global business services (GBS) revenue also grew 6% to   $4.3 billion, as its consulting and application management   revenue spiked 10% and 4%, respectively. The unit saw high demand   for its AI and automation solutions for enterprise customers, and   it streamlined the unit by divesting its mortgage servicing   business. Non-GAAP gross margin expanded 10 basis points annually to   49.5%, as a significant expansion of its GBS margins offset the   weakness of its systems unit. That expansion, along with the   divestments of its software and mortgage service units, should   buoy IBM's earnings growth this year -- even as it integrates Red   Hat's operations. The acquisition of Red Hat could also revive IBM's slumping SI   and cloud revenue growth, which could offset the declines of its   legacy businesses again. IBM expects the Red Hat takeover to   boost its revenue by a five-year CAGR of 200 basis   points. Lastly, IBM's stock remains fairly cheap at less than 10 times   this year's earnings with a forward dividend yield of 5.1%. That   low valuation and high yield should limit its downside in this   choppy market. So has IBM bottomed out? I wasn't impressed by IBM's fourth-quarter report, and don't   think its takeover of Red Hat is a magic bullet for all its   problems. Though IBM's stock might finally be bottoming out, I   don't see any convincing signs of a turnaround or a sustainable   rally yet.   10 stocks we like better than IBM       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 Each week, I'm   ranking the biggest companies    that trade on U.S. exchanges based on their size (   market capitalization    ), momentum (total return over the past year), and recent news.   Before we get to the rankings, a quick word on a major   player. It's not easy being   Facebook    (NASDAQ: FB) these days. The stock has shed more than a fifth of   its value, and investors continue to be concerned about the   social networking giant's ability to spruce up its reputation as   data privacy fears intensify. Thankfully for investors, there's more to Facebook than its   namesake site. It owns several platforms that are holding up   considerably better than its flagship platform, and Facebook may   be ready to   cash in on the success of its sister projects    .   The New York Times     reports that that Facebook plans to mesh its WhatsApp,   Instagram, and Messenger platforms together. The three services   will continue to run on their own, but the messaging   infrastructure will be unified as early as next year.makeArticleAd(); With that in mind, let's review this week's updated list of 50   top large-cap stocks, kicking things off with the top 10.   Image source: Getty Images.  This week's top 10 stocks  10. Walmart    (NYSE: WMT) : $281.6 billion, down 9.1% over the past year. The leading retail chain moved higher on the week after a   couple of positive analyst moves.   Capital One    (NYSE: COF) also discussed its agreement to acquire the existing   portfolio of Walmart's co-branded and private-label credit card   receivables. Capital One is taking on roughly $9 billion in   receivables in the process, building on long-term credit card   agreement that the two companies entered into over the   summer.  9. Pfizer    (NYSE: PFE)  (down from 7): $234.9 billion, up 9.2%. The pharmaceuticals giant is sliding down a few notches this   week, after an analyst downgraded the stock. Navin Jacob at UBS   is lowering his rating on Pfizer from ""buy"" to ""neutral,""   slashing his price target from $48.50 to $46. He thinks the   stock's valuation is less compelling than it was in his   previously bullish update.  8. Alibaba    (NYSE: BABA)  (up from 9): $412.7 billion market cap, down   19.7%. China's leading online marketplace was treated to dueling   analyst notes. Baird lowered its estimates for Alibaba on   Tuesday, pointing to the deceleration of online sales in China   given its slowing economy. Rob Sanderson at MKM Partners followed   with a rosier outlook later in the week, arguing that margin   pressure will reverse this year. He continues to tag Alibaba as   his top pick among the megacap stocks. Both analysts do have   bullish ratings on the stock, but their price targets are $67   apart.  7. Facebook    (up from 8): $428.2 billion market cap, down 20.5%. The social-networking leader will get a good chance to move   during the week ahead.

Morgan put out a positive note on Facebook ahead   of its report, seeing continuing strength at Instagram and easier   comparisons for Facebook itself when it comes to time spent on   the platform when pitted against the prior year's shocking   slowdown.  6. Visa    (NYSE: V) : $ 305.7 billion, up 10.7%. It's earnings season, and the world's leading credit card   company is expected to post another period of double-digit growth   on both ends of its income statement on Wednesday. Analysts see   Visa checking in with $5.4 billion in revenue for the quarter,   11% ahead of where it was a year earlier. They see profits   growing even faster, with earnings per share rising 16% to $1.25.   The cashless revolution continues to gain traction.  5. Berkshire Hathaway    (NYSE: BRK-A) : $498.8 billion, down 6%. A Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary hoping to produce lithium for   batteries has come under fire. A   Financial Times    report raised some doubts about the technological process in   extracting lithium from California geothermal wells. Berkshire   Hathaway's market cap also dipped below $500 billion.  4. Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) : $746.2 billion, down 7.8%. All eyes will be on Apple when it reports its fiscal   first-quarter results on Tuesday. Apple has already confirmed   that iPhone sales were sluggish during the holiday-containing   quarter, and the stock continues to trade lower over the past   year. Wall Street's views are mixed ahead of the numbers. William   Power at Baird is cautious, arguing that the consensus estimates   may still be too high given the continuing challenges in China   and even its home market. Katy Huberty at Morgan Stanley thinks   the pessimism is running thick, giving Apple a lower bar to clear   in impressing investors on Tuesday.  3. Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) : $762.4 billion, down 6.8%. Stifel analyst Scott Devitt is lowering his price target on   Alphabet from $1,400 to $1,300. He thinks Google's parent company   turned in a solid fourth quarter, but he sees revenue growth and   margins in the year ahead coming in slightly below his earlier   forecast. Several ad agencies have been lowering their global   growth projections for 2019, and Devitt thinks the reduced   spending will affect Alphabet's core online business. He's still   bullish on Alphabet but more cautious about the stock's near-term   prospects for appreciation.  2. Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN)  (down from 1): $816.9 billion, up 21.2%. Amazon is always looking for ways use high-tech to improve its   efficiency, and its latest project is an autonomous delivery   system. Amazon Scout is designed to get packages to its customers   through autonomous devices that are about the size of a small   cooler, rolling along sidewalks at a walking pace. They can   navigate around pets, pedestrians, and anything else in their   way. The first test of the high-tech delivery platform began this   past week in a Snohomish County neighborhood in its home   state of Washington.  1. Microsoft    (NASDAQ: MSFT) (up from 2): $822.8 billion, up 16.1%. Mr. Softy is on top again. It's overtaken Amazon in market cap   since last week, and while its trailing return is slightly less,   we continue to reward momentum here. On the downside, Bing   suffered a brief hiccup in China, leaving the online search   engine inaccessible earlier in the week. The rank and file We'll get to No. 11 through No. 50 in a moment, but first,   let's look at one of the other Top 50 stocks making waves, for   better or worse. In a story involving four members of our top 50,   UnitedHealth Group    's (NYSE: UNH) Optum unit is suing a former IT executive who left   to help get a rival concept off the ground. Amazon, Berkshire   Hathaway, and   JPMorgan Chase    (NYSE: JPM) hired David Smith to help revolutionize the   healthcare industry. UnitedHealth thinks the hire is a threat to   Optum's trade secrets and other confidential information. The lawsuit claims Smith was attending strategy meetings at   UnitedHealth and seeking out confidential information from   employees even as it was interviewing for the new Amazon-helmed   venture. It also says Smith printed an Optum document that was   marked as confidential a minute before printing his resume.   That's cold if true. We'll see how this story plays out in the   coming weeks.

Costco    (NASDAQ: COST) : $92.1 billion, up 5.6%.  50. Toyota    (NYSE: TM) (new): $175.8 billion, down 10.9%. Who's in and who's out Toyota revs its way back onto our list this week. It is the   world's most valuable automaker by market cap, and it's the only   car manufacturer on the list despite its negative return over the   past year. Toyota announced last week that it will team up with   consumer-electronics giant   Panasonic    to form a joint venture to make electric-vehicle batteries.   Toyota will own 51% of the joint venture. The Japanese company also isn't losing sight of its growth   prospects in China. Toyota is forecasting 8% growth in China this   year, a projection that would call for moving 1.6 million   vehicles in a country where the economy is slowing. Toyota replaces   Citigroup    (NYSE: C) , bumped after a single week on the list. The banking   and financial-services giant is certainly large enough to make   the list, clocking in at $151.6 billion, but the stock's 19.4%   decline over the past year has kept it on the outside looking in.   Banking stocks have generally had a good start to 2019, but Citi   continues to be a laggard among the financial-services   heavyweights. One to watch There's a lot going on at   Comcast    (NASDAQ: CMCSA)  these days. The company behind the   country's leading cable television and internet service provider,   as well as the parent company of NBCUniversal, posted   better-than-expected fourth-quarter results    last week. It's not losing as many cable television subscribers   as its smaller rivals to the cord-cutting revolution, shedding   just 29,000 video customers in the fourth quarter, and it more   than made up for that loss with the net addition of 351,000   high-speed internet accounts. Universal's   Glass    continues to be the top draw at the local multiplex. Comcast also   recently tossed its hat into the streaming ring, announcing a   standalone NBCUniversal service that should come out in 2020. Comcast is one of the most valuable companies not on the list,   as its $162.8 billion market cap is undermined by the stock's 15%   slide over the past year. The stock moved higher following   Wednesday's encouraging financial report. If the company is able   to keep the momentum going, it wouldn't be a surprise if Comcast   claws its way back on to the list.   10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (A     shares)       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Reuters

By David Randall
NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. fund managers are continuing their retreat from consumer-related stocks and increasing their defensive bets out of concerns that the U.S. economy is slowing even though government leaders had reached agreement to end the longest shutdown ever. 
While the S&P 500 index is up more than 5 percent since the start of January, money managers including Federated Investors, Baron Funds and Hodges Capital Management are bracing for a powerful knock-on effect on the consumer. The shutdown  left roughly 800,000 federal workers without pay for 35 days, and U.S. consumer confidence fell in December by its largest amount in three years. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Trump said that the government may shut down again on Feb. 15 or he will declare a national emergency if Congress does not appropriate money for a border wall. 
""The market right now is treating this like a hurricane, where you know there will be an economic impact but you tend to discount any hit to the data because you know there will be some catch up,"" said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. ""But here's what's dangerous about that approach: the sample size is zero for shutdowns this long.""
As a result, Chiavarone said he is becoming more cautious on consumer stocks. He noted that these probably saw revenue declines as government employees cut back and as that affected spending by owners or employees of restaurants, hotels, and retailers that depend on their business.
Shawn Kravetz, Esplanade Capital LLC's chief investment officer, said he expected consumer stocks like Walmart Inc  and dollar-store chains like Dollar Tree Inc  to benefit as furloughed workers ""trade down"" into more value-oriented chains, leaving higher-end department stores and travel companies ripe for a slowdown.
""There's no question that life is about cash flow. Even if you are highly confident that you will eventually get paid, people will pull in their horns and hunker down,"" he said.


PAST SHUTDOWNS
The benchmark S&P 500 has been little changed during past government shutdowns, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of U.S. equity strategy at New York-based CFRA.
Each of the more than 20 government shutdowns since the 1970s has lasted a week on average and left the S&P 500 essentially flat, he said. The longest, a 21-day shutdown from December 1995 to January 1996, saw the S&P 500 rise 0.1 percent during the shutdown itself and gain 4 percent in the month after it finished.
Michael Lippert, a portfolio manager at Baron Funds, said the shutdown is not likely to leave a lasting impact on portfolio holdings such as Amazon.com Inc  that are still grabbing market share. Still, it could curtail investor enthusiasm for initial public offerings, he said.
""Sentiment affects stock prices in the short term and my bigger worry is what dysfunction in D.C. will do to market confidence,"" he said. ""Could we see a pullback on the magnitude of what we saw in December? It's certainly possible.""
Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management, said the firm is underweight restaurant stocks in part because of the government shutdown and concerns about slowing economic growth.
Marshall expects to see more companies lowering guidance as they report earnings over the coming weeks. S&P 500 earnings are now expected to grow by 5.9 percent in 2019, compared to October estimates that earnings would grow by 10.2 percent, according to data from Refinitiv.
""You're going to start seeing over the next couple of weeks whether companies factor the shutdown into their guidance, and whether it's going to start to have some negative momentum in the economy,"" he said.

357,"January 26, 2019, 12:03:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,FedEx Is Helping Big-Box Retailers Compete With Amazon,"
 Big-box retailers such as   Walmart    (NYSE: WMT) and   Target    (NYSE: TGT) have always had one big advantage over   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) . They have hundreds of stores spread throughout   the United States, which they can use to help get items to online   customers' doorsteps more quickly. Target has been pushing to fulfill more orders through its   stores for a couple of years now. The company said all of its   digital sales growth in November and December last year was   fueled by   store-fulfilled orders    , including in-store pickup orders. Walmart's head of e-commerce,   Marc Lore, has repeatedly noted that his strategy for competing   with Amazon relies on using the company's 4,600 locations to get   items to customers. He's gone so far as experimenting with having   associates deliver orders   on their way home    from work.  FedEx    (NYSE: FDX) recently stepped in by offering a better solution for   big-box retailers to get items from their stores to customers.   Retailers can use its Extra Hours service to guarantee fast   shipping even when customers place their orders in the   evening.makeArticleAd();   Image source: FedEx.   Late-night shopping  Most online orders are placed after 5 p.m., when people finish   working for the day. The problem is, couriers such as FedEx   generally pick up shipments during standard business hours, so an   after-dinner order usually won't even make its way into FedEx's   hands until the next morning. If a retailer pays for Extra Hours, FedEx will come by the   store early in the morning the next day and sweep for customer   orders. In some metro areas, FedEx can take those orders directly   to customers' doors. In other cases, they'll have to go to a   local FedEx facility, but they'll still get to customers within   two days. That's a lot faster than the standard process. FedEx used to   go to a retailer's distribution center and then sort at a local   facility. Going straight to the stores can shave two or three   days off the process. If retailers can use their stores to fulfill online orders   more effectively, it can save a significant amount in capital   expenditures. Amazon has invested a ton of money building out its   distribution network, which currently consists of 75 locations in   North America. Not only that, but Amazon also pays 125,000   full-time employees to operate those fulfillment centers. Target   has boasted that its store-fulfilled digital orders improve its   operating efficiency by making use of excess work capacity at its   stores.  Is it enough to compete with Amazon?  The No. 1 reason consumers subscribe to Amazon Prime is the   two-day shipping benefit. In a Diffusion Group survey last   summer, 79% said it's the No. 1 benefit of the program. People place a lot of value on fast shipping. So it stands to   reason that if other retailers can offer fast shipping thanks to   FedEx and their networks of physical stores, Amazon Prime might   lose some of its value. That's especially true when those other   retailers aren't charging for two-day shipping. But it's not just fast shipping customers prize. It's fast   shipping of Amazon's catalog.  Product selection   consistently ranks near the top of surveys asking why shoppers   choose Amazon.        Amazon has over 100 million Prime-eligible items for sale in the   United States. That selection is bolstered by its third-party   marketplace and its Fulfilled by Amazon program. Third-party   merchants can store their inventory at Amazon's warehouse, making   their items Prime-eligible. Walmart, by comparison, has only a few million items on its   website eligible for two-day shipping. Target has even fewer   items -- ""hundreds of thousands."" Walmart is working with some of its marketplace sellers to   ensure two-day delivery, but without the warehouse and   fulfillment-center network Amazon has,  it still can't   compete on product selection, and it's not a viable option for   smaller sellers. FedEx's Extra Hours service is a worthwhile investment for   both big-box retailers and FedEx, but it won't hurt the value of   Amazon Prime. Using stores to fulfill orders is an advantage on   some items, but it will never enable retailers to compete with   Amazon's ability to quickly deliver a broad product selection --   the real benefit of Amazon Prime.   10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Using stores to fulfill orders is an advantage on   some items, but it will never enable retailers to compete with   Amazon's ability to quickly deliver a broad product selection --   the real benefit of Amazon Prime.",6,0.3284666666666667

By SA Editor Mike Taylor, CFA :Dear ESSENTIAL subscribers:Hi! I'm Seeking Alpha managing editor Mike Taylor. Welcome to ESSENTIAL Weekly, a subscriber-exclusive look at Seeking Alpha's top news and analysis. I'll guide you through this week's market themes, highlight some analysis you might have missed, and preview coming attractions for SA subscribers.Don't be bashful: We need to hear from you so we can make ESSENTIAL the best investment research tool available anywhere. Let me know what the Seeking Alpha team can do - your feedback is key to our success.makeArticleAd();Now let's get to the good stuff.Government Shutdown: What CEOs Are SayingOn Friday, I compiled a sample of recent earnings conference call references to the government shutdown.Companies operating under agency regulation - banks, pharmas, aviation-related firms - are cautiously optimistic but have also noticed some disruptions to their typical activities as the shutdown wears on. It will be interesting to monitor this dynamic as earnings season picks up next week.Digital Media Layoffs Are A Current Economic IndicatorTo the extent he's known outside media circles at all, Gawker Media founder Nick Denton is known today for his company's demise. In 2012, WWE star Hulk Hogan sued Gawker for $100 million over publication of a sex tape and, after a judicial circus, the company filed for bankruptcy and was eventually sold for parts.But if we go back to 2008, well before the weird unwind of his controversial and sleazy blog network, Nick Denton displayed uncanny foresight (and characteristic ruthlessness) by laying off a bunch of staff and consolidating his sites in October of that year:You can guess the reason for these brutal measures: the recession. Sure, the company is currently profitable and advertising sales are up by about 30% on their level of a year ago. Our biggest clients are consumer electronics and entertainment companies that are relatively well insulated. And, yes, this is not the first time I've predicted doom: in July 2006, when we ""battened down the hatches"" and closed down Sploid and Screenhead; and in April this year, when we spun off Idolator, Gridskipper and Wonkette. But now the credit crisis is clearly going to affect every sector of the economy. Advertising buys typically plunge after the Christmas shopping season, and 2009 is obviously going to be exceptionally difficult. We have to prepare for the worst, now, rather than when the worst comes upon us.The thesis I intend to explore here is that while layoffs and unemployment on the whole are lagging economic indicators, media industry layoffs lead or coincide with the cycle. You could argue Denton was ahead of the macro curve.(Source: FRED)It's tough to neatly patch together how the Great Recession unfolded, and people certainly were expecting a fair amount of carnage by October 2008. ("" Bear Stearns Day "" was back in March of that year, and Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy a few weeks before Denton's announcement).But according to Denton's detailed rationale for the layoffs, he saw himself as uniquely bearish heading into 2009: ""Advertising forecasts don't anticipate a deep recession,"" he wrote, presciently, in bold type. There's reason to take him at his word. This New York Times article from November 2008 shows that weeks after Denton slimmed Gawker down, Citigroup ( C ) was still making surprise layoff announcements from the very center of the crisis.Could a similar pattern emerge in 2019? This week newsrooms are laying off employees in fairly large numbers:BuzzFeed announced Wednesday that it would lay off 15% of its workforce, or about 220 employees; Verizon announced it would cut 7% or approximately 800 jobs from its media division, which includes brands like HuffPost, AOL and Yahoo News; and Gannett slashed dozens of jobs at newspapers across the country.A decade after Denton's mid-recession bearish call, have media companies learned from him and gotten ahead of a coming round of economic seizures?Outside the narrow and self-regarding world of the news media, you can make a case that content and entertainment are key drivers of the current economy. All four FANG stocks have meaningful exposure to, or have invested tremendously in, the advertising and attention economy. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is a giant ad-targeting business; Amazon ( AMZN ) has Prime Video, Netflix ( NFLX ) is a subscription video streamer, and for all its sprawling technological investments Alphabet ( GOOG , GOOGL ) draws a great deal of value from search and ad sales.I wonder whether investors underestimate the cyclicality of media business models. Even though a lot of the rise of FANG has to do with secular technological innovation, at the bottom of it all is consumers' propensity for discretionary spending on entertainment and companies' appetite to buy ads.Netflix is the only one of the four with an earnings report out. As typifies this battleground stock, Seeking Alpha authors are all over the map with their expectations. Bang For The Buck offers an interesting look at Netflix's cash burn and potential dependency on financial markets going forward. Dan Victor meanwhile outlines in granular detail his expectations for future subscriber growth , and he remains long-term bullish on the company.Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet are expected to report Q4 results in the next two weeks. Public sentiment toward tech giants has soured, as evidenced by Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) CEO Jack Dorsey's recent press tour .Meanwhile, the FOMC meeting will be 1/29-1/30 . Investors are in for an interesting mosaic of tech company earnings and market signaling from the Fed next week. We may get a chance to test my hypothesis about media layoffs in the coming months.Investment Strategy StatementsTo make it easier to find authors whose strategies fit your own, Seeking Alpha editors have begun publishing authors' Investment Strategy Statements. These articles are designed to give a broad overview of an author's approach, and let readers know more about the thought process behind the analysis.

I selected Paul Franke's "" Will Capital One's Consumer Loan Business Survive The Next Recession?

Meanwhile, Eric Basmajian continues his tour of the financial services industry by asking, "" What Can Capital One Tell Us About The Cycle? ""Meanwhile, SA editor John Leonard highlights "" Asia Pacific Wire & Cable: Massively Mispriced Stock Selling Below Liquidation Value "" as one of his favorite articles this week: ""Many investors equate net-net stocks with value traps as often the stock trades at a discount for legitimate reasons (e.g. value unlikely to be realized and/or resources wasted).

 If you're trying to handicap the eternal race for eyeballs in   the entertainment industry, you could do worse than look to the   Oscars. While the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences may   not do much to reward the action-adventure tentpole films that   bring in the biggest box office, they do tend to gravitate to   quality. And quality quietly pays off down the road. In this segment of the    MarketFoolery     podcast, host Chris Hill and Taylor Muckerman of Motley Fool   Canada look at the big picture on the business side, reflecting   on how   Disney    (NYSE: DIS) ,   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) ,   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) and others did, as well as what the impact of a   nice trophy haul could have on services like Hulu and the   forthcoming Disney Plus.

This video was recorded on Jan. 22, 2019.   Chris Hill:    As I mentioned, the Academy Award nominations came out this   morning. As fans of movies, we look at this news through the lens   of movies that we saw and enjoyed and maybe we're rooting for. As   investors, we look at this news through the lens of investing. It   shakes out with Disney as a studio getting 16 nominations,   Netflix getting 13 nominations, including its first-ever   nomination for Best Picture with   Roma    . Amazon Studios coming in with three. One more bit of good news   for Disney and Netflix shareholders.  Taylor Muckerman:    Yeah, absolutely. It seems like a one-two punch with these two   companies. When you look at Disney's content spending, when you   remove sports, Netflix is almost right there with them. It didn't   take long for that company to catch up. As you mentioned, Amazon   getting a few bids. They're nipping right on the heels of Netflix   with that content spending. Ramping it up, and not spending just   willy nilly. Apparently, they're making wise decisions on the   directors, the cast, the themes of these movies and shows. Very   well done for these companies. If you're a shareholder, that's   absolutely what you want to see. Without shows and movies for the   subscribers to want to watch, what's the business really   worth?  Hill:    There absolutely is economic upside. We've seen the data year   after year that films that get these nominations and win the   Academy Awards end up getting a boost at the box office. I should   point out that Disney was 16 nominations, Netflix with 13.   Netflix actually came in third. Fox Searchlight as a studio came   in second with 15. You look at Disney's acquisition of   Fox    , Fox Searchlight, 15 nominations. 20th Century Fox with five.   Really, the Disney properties coming in with, what, 36? Hopefully   -- I say this as a fan of movies and as a Disney shareholder --   they're just going to let the Fox Searchlight people keep doing   what they're doing, and maybe not meddle too much. That's a   studio that has performed very well in terms of awards   season.  Muckerman:    One thing I saw that interested me a little bit was the projected   additions of Hulu subscribers in 2018 are supposed to trump   Netflix for the first time ever. Obviously, Disney now owns a   sizable stake of Hulu. You can imagine those movies being rolled   down maybe strictly to Hulu subscribers. A nice little bump there   for the subscription business on top of Disney+, which will be   coming out soon.  Hill:    It's going to be interesting to see what Disney does with Hulu   and if three years from now, we see some sort of merging of the   Disney streaming app and Hulu, or if they're able to manage them   separately and make them both grow.  Muckerman:    Definitely curious about that myself. I have no predictions, but   it'll be interesting to see.

Reuters

@media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}



By David Randall
NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. fund managers are continuing their retreat from consumer-related stocks and increasing their defensive bets out of concerns that the U.S. economy is slowing even though government leaders had reached agreement to end the longest shutdown ever. 
While the S&P 500 index is up more than 5 percent since the start of January, money managers including Federated Investors, Baron Funds and Hodges Capital Management are bracing for a powerful knock-on effect on the consumer. The shutdown  left roughly 800,000 federal workers without pay for 35 days, and U.S. consumer confidence fell in December by its largest amount in three years. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Trump said that the government may shut down again on Feb. 15 or he will declare a national emergency if Congress does not appropriate money for a border wall. 
""The market right now is treating this like a hurricane, where you know there will be an economic impact but you tend to discount any hit to the data because you know there will be some catch up,"" said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors. ""But here's what's dangerous about that approach: the sample size is zero for shutdowns this long.""
As a result, Chiavarone said he is becoming more cautious on consumer stocks. He noted that these probably saw revenue declines as government employees cut back and as that affected spending by owners or employees of restaurants, hotels, and retailers that depend on their business.
Shawn Kravetz, Esplanade Capital LLC's chief investment officer, said he expected consumer stocks like Walmart Inc  and dollar-store chains like Dollar Tree Inc  to benefit as furloughed workers ""trade down"" into more value-oriented chains, leaving higher-end department stores and travel companies ripe for a slowdown.
""There's no question that life is about cash flow. Even if you are highly confident that you will eventually get paid, people will pull in their horns and hunker down,"" he said.


PAST SHUTDOWNS
The benchmark S&P 500 has been little changed during past government shutdowns, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of U.S. equity strategy at New York-based CFRA.
Each of the more than 20 government shutdowns since the 1970s has lasted a week on average and left the S&P 500 essentially flat, he said. The longest, a 21-day shutdown from December 1995 to January 1996, saw the S&P 500 rise 0.1 percent during the shutdown itself and gain 4 percent in the month after it finished.
Michael Lippert, a portfolio manager at Baron Funds, said the shutdown is not likely to leave a lasting impact on portfolio holdings such as Amazon.com Inc  that are still grabbing market share. Still, it could curtail investor enthusiasm for initial public offerings, he said.
""Sentiment affects stock prices in the short term and my bigger worry is what dysfunction in D.C. will do to market confidence,"" he said. ""Could we see a pullback on the magnitude of what we saw in December? It's certainly possible.""
Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management, said the firm is underweight restaurant stocks in part because of the government shutdown and concerns about slowing economic growth.
Marshall expects to see more companies lowering guidance as they report earnings over the coming weeks. S&P 500 earnings are now expected to grow by 5.9 percent in 2019, compared to October estimates that earnings would grow by 10.2 percent, according to data from Refinitiv.
""You're going to start seeing over the next couple of weeks whether companies factor the shutdown into their guidance, and whether it's going to start to have some negative momentum in the economy,"" he said.

372,"January 25, 2019, 09:12:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Brinker's (EAT) Traffic-Driving Efforts to Drive Q2 Earnings,"
  Brinker International, Inc. EAT  is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jan 29, before the market opens. The company's ambitious expansion plans, along with sales building, digital, operational and remodeling initiatives, are likely to have favored top-line growth in the fiscal second quarter while focus on franchising and other operational excellence may have driven earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. The company has recorded earnings growth of 11.9%, 9.2%, 14.9% and 22.5% in the past four respective quarters, thereby, setting an upside trend. Moreover, the company's earnings surpassed the consensus estimate in five of the trailing six quarters, the average beat being 7.2%. Backed by this solid earnings trend, shares of Brinker have gained 21.5% over the past year, outperforming the industry  's 5.6% rally.  makeArticleAd();      Let us delve deeper to find out how the company's results will shape up in the fiscal second quarter.  Sales-Building Efforts to Drive Top-Line Growth  Brinker remains steadfast in its goal to drive traffic and revenues through a range of sales-building initiatives. These include streamlining of menu and its innovation, strengthening value proposition, better food presentation, advertising campaigns, kitchen system optimization, and the introduction of a better service platform. Particularly, emphasizing on menu innovation to propel revenues, the company started a plan - Vision 2020 - in 2016, focusing on menu innovation in Chili's, continuous improvement in service and atmosphere to differentiate the brand, and gain market traction to achieve long-term earnings per share growth target of 10-15%. Meanwhile, Brinker's remodeling efforts gained momentum, leading to improvement in sales. Notably, the company continues to invest in its reimage program. In fact, in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, it invested in a brand-wide reimage program that will drive traffic and comps over the next three years. Brinker's remodeling initiative is thus expected to continue to invigorate its potential as a brand and augment guests' experience. Backed by rigorous top-line initiatives, Brinker witnessed 1.9% revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. This trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal second quarter as well. Subsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the fiscal second quarter is pegged at $778.8 million, reflecting 1.6% year-over-year growth.  Bottom-line Picture Impressive  In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Brinker recorded earnings growth of 11.9% year over year. Also, the consensus estimate pegs earnings at 89 cents for the fiscal second quarter, suggesting 2.3% growth from the year-ago quarter. We believe that the company's earnings are favored by the focus on franchising. Unlike most peers, Brinker used to focus on company-owned restaurants to gain full control over its operations and profits. However, to survive in an industry that depends largely on franchising, the company started to pursue expansion through franchisees and partnerships. For instance, Brinker acquired 103 franchised Chili's Grill and Bar restaurants from Pepper Dining Holding Corp. in 2015. Notably, in fiscal 2017, Brinker's franchise-operated locations increased 40%. Strong growth should continue to boost top and bottom lines of the company.  What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?  Our proven model does not show that Brinker is likely to bea t earnings  estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive  Earnings ESP   and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter  . Brinker has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Although the company's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

Quote    Stocks to Consider  Here are a few stocks from the  Retail-Wholesale   space that investors may consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the fourth quarter: Amazon AMZN  has an Earnings ESP of +0.68% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The company is scheduled to report quarterly results on Feb 7. Caseys General Stores CASY  has an Earnings ESP of +18.15% and it currently sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company is expected to report quarterly results on Mar 6. RH RH  has an Earnings ESP of +15.19% and it presently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1. The company is expected to report quarterly results on Mar 26.  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All  Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

The company has recorded earnings growth of 11.9%, 9.2%, 14.9% and 22.5% in the past four respective quarters, thereby, setting an upside trend.
Backed by rigorous top-line initiatives, Brinker witnessed 1.9% revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2019.
Subsequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the fiscal second quarter is pegged at $778.8 million, reflecting 1.6% year-over-year growth.
Bottom-line Picture Impressive  In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Brinker recorded earnings growth of 11.9% year over year.
Also, the consensus estimate pegs earnings at 89 cents for the fiscal second quarter, suggesting 2.3% growth from the year-ago quarter.
Although the company's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

373,"January 25, 2019, 08:59:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Xilinx (XLNX) Rallies on Impressive Q3 Results & Upbeat View,"
 On Jan 25, Xilinx XLNX  was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Shares of the company scaled a new 52-week high of $107.65, eventually closing at $106.6 on Jan 24. Moreover, shares gained about 18.4% in yesterday's trading session. Investors seem to be impressed by the company's third-quarter fiscal 2019 performance wherein both earnings and revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate and also witnessed a year-over-year improvement. This upside can be attributed to the company's strength in Advanced Products, which soared 51% year over year, and broad-based growth across most of its end markets. Looking forward to the fiscal fourth quarter, Xilinx expects revenues to be in the range of $815-$830 million. This is ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $775.5 million. Notably, the stock has appreciated 52.1% in the past year versus the S&P 500 Composite's decline of 7%.         Rationale Behind the Share Rally  Xilinx is witnessing a strong uptick in the Communications market, driven by an improved Wireless business, which is benefiting from early 5G production, pre-5G deployments and LTE upgrades. Notably, 5G deployments in South Korea and a very early start of ramping up the 5G deployments in China are key drivers. The growing usage of Zynq RFSoCs and ACAP products for 5G deployments by both basebands and radios is a positive. Additionally, major design wins from hyperscalers globally for accelerating applications beyond FPGA as a Service (FaaS) enhanced results. The company's software defined development environment, SDAccel, is helping it stay ahead of Intel INTC  in datacenter acceleration. Notably, with regard to FaaS, the company recorded additional engagements beyond previously announced deployments with Amazon AMZN  , Alibaba BABA  and Huawei. Xilinx also expanded its portfolio of Alveo accelerator cards with U280 products apart from U200 & U250. The company projects modest revenue growth from Alveo this year but expects it to be a more meaningful contributor in the next fiscal year. Xilinx's ongoing transition from a field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) provider to an all-programmable devices producer is aiding it to gain a sizeable market share. To this end, its newly launched 7nm ACAP (Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform) Versal platform is touted to be a game changer. The above-mentioned tailwinds have raised investors' optimism on the stock and will likely boost the company's share price in the coming days.   Xilinx, Inc. Revenue (TTM)      Xilinx, Inc.

374,"January 25, 2019, 08:24:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Better Buy: Costco vs. Amazon.com,"
 Despite the onslaught of nimble e-commerce start-ups over the   last 20 years,   Costco Wholesale    (NASDAQ: COST) is still outperforming the broader market. In the   previous five years, shares of Costco have increased by 86%   versus the   S&P 500    's return of 42%. On the other side, it seems   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) can do no wrong. Even when it makes a mistake   (like the   Fire Phone    ), Amazon keeps growing. Over the last five years, the stock has   shot up 306%, which puts it up nearly 32,000% for the   last 20 years. Despite both companies' strong history of returns, past   performance does not assure future results. With that in mind,   I'll compare both companies' financial fortitude, valuation, and   competitive advantages to determine which stock is the better buy   for investors.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Getty Images.  Financial fortitude It's always beneficial to invest in a company that has a   rock-solid balance sheet. The company that generates more free   cash flow and has more cash sitting in the bank can weather   downturns in the economy and expand its competitive moat while   competitors flounder. Additionally, cash can be used to reward shareholders in the   form of share repurchases and dividends. Here's a look at how Costco and Amazon stack up on key   financial metrics:    Metric Costco Wholesale Amazon.com   Cash $7.953 billion $29.765 billion   Debt $6.48 billion $24.684 billion   Free cash flow (TTM) $3.066 billion $13.36 billion   Revenue (TTM) $144.84 billion $220.96 billion   Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue 2.1% 6%    Data source: The companies and Y-Charts. TTM = trailing 12   months. Amazon is a larger business, with $221 billion in   trailing-12-month revenue versus Costco's $145 billion. As a   result, we should expect Amazon to have more cash on the balance   sheet. Amazon generates significantly more free cash flow as a   percentage of revenue than Costco, which tilts the advantage to   the online retailer.  Winner: Amazon.  Valuation Here's how Costco and Amazon compare on a range of popular   valuation metrics:    Metric Costco Wholesale Amazon.com   Trailing P/E 28.7 94.6   Forward P/E 27.4 62.2   P/Free cash flow 30.5 63.0   P/Sales 0.65 3.8   PEG ratio 2.46 2.0   Dividend yield 1.05% N/A (doesn't pay a dividend)   Dividend payout as a percentage of free cash flow 38.81% N/A    P/E = price to earnings. PEG = price/earnings to growth. Data   source: Y-Charts and Yahoo! Finance. Neither stock is cheap, but Costco is more conservatively   valued. Amazon does have a lower   PEG (price-to-earnings-growth) ratio    , but not by much. We are long in the tooth of a bull market, and   any slowdown in Amazon's growth would likely cause its high P/E   to contract, which would hurt returns in the short run. Overall, Costco's significantly lower P/E ratio and dividend   yield make the stock a better value. Amazon doesn't pay a   dividend.  Winner: Costco.  Competitive advantage Both companies are focused on keeping costs down to sell   merchandise at competitive prices. Costco is cheaper on most   items, but that hasn't prevented Amazon from growing more   than the warehouse store over the years. Despite Amazon's ascent,   Costco still looks poised for long-term growth, given it has an   88% membership renewal rate worldwide, and the company has   seen higher sign-up rates from millennials, which is an   encouraging sign for   future growth    . However, Amazon has the advantage here because the company has   grown much faster and is chewing up market share of   brick-and-mortar retailers. For example, 20 years ago, Costco   generated $24 billion in revenue when Amazon was a tiny   fraction of that size. In 2016, Amazon surpassed Costco in   total revenue. Amazon has grown the top line 183% over the   last five years, while Costco increased revenue just 34%. Of course, part of Amazon's faster rate of growth is due to   its booming cloud business (Amazon Web Services). However,   even if we isolate Amazon's core retail business in North   America, revenue growth is still robust, up 35% in the third   quarter. Amazon is set to overtake Walmart as the No. 1   apparel retailer in the U.S., according to research from   Wells Fargo    . The online, do-it-all juggernaut is leaving Costco in the   dust. The combination of Amazon Prime, Echo smart-home devices,   and Amazon's unrivaled customer service is winning over loyal   shoppers in droves. Amazon could also gain significant share in   grocery -- Costco's home turf --   through its acquisition of Whole Foods    . Costco management admitted during the last       earnings conference call    that it saw some competitive pressure in groceries from larger   rivals.  Winner: Amazon.  Amazon is the better buy And there you have it. Costco wins on valuation, and it offers   a   dividend yield,    which income investors should favor. However, Amazon stock will   likely outperform Costco shares over the long term, even with   Amazon's higher valuation. There are two main reasons that Amazon's growth is far from   over. First, e-commerce still makes up less than 10% of domestic   retail sales. Second, Amazon still has a tremendous   opportunity to grow its cloud business. One analyst is on record   stating that Amazon Web Services could be worth   nearly half    of Amazon's current market capitalization in just a few   years. Amazon has an $801 billion market cap, but it's still   growing like a start-up business. For all of these reasons,   investors are better off paying up for Amazon.   10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

Reuters

By Aditya Kalra and Aftab Ahmed
NEW DELHI, Jan 25 (Reuters) - A Hindu nationalist group close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party has urged him to resist pressure from the United States and not defer new regulations for the e-commerce sector, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The economic wing of the group, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which is the fountainhead of the ruling party, has written to Modi saying that changing the policy implementation date, under pressure from Washington, will hurt 130 million small Indian entrepreneurs.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
The new rules, to be implemented from Feb. 1, will deal a blow to Walmart Inc  and Amazon.com's  ambitions in the country. They mandate that e-commerce companies will not be allowed to sell products from firms in which they have an equity interest.
Reuters reported on Thursday the United States government had told Indian officials the new rules will hinder the investment plans of the two companies. 
The rules, which will force the companies to change their business structures and raise operational costs, have sparked an extensive lobbying effort from both Amazon and Walmart, which last year invested $16 billion in Indian e-commerce company Flipkart.
Both Amazon and Walmart have sought an extension of the Feb. 1 deadline, but government sources have said that was unlikely to happen as Modi needs millions of traders by his side in an upcoming national election due by May.
On Friday, the Confederation of All India Traders, which has supported tougher scrutiny of large e-commerce players, said ""the entire trading community will vote against the government if they extend the deadline"".
The e-commerce spat is the latest in a number of disputes over trade and investment relations between India and the United States.
Walmart spokesman Greg Hitt told Reuters this week the company had ""engaged the (United States) administration on this issue"".
The RSS has long advocated self-reliance and opposed the opening up of the Indian economy to foreign players.
Small Indian retailers have alleged that e-commerce companies use their control over inventory from their affiliates to create an unfair marketplace that allows them to sell some products at lower prices, which hurts the businesses of brick-and-mortar retailers. Such arrangements would be barred under the new policy.
In front-page advertisements in newspapers last week, Walmart-owned Flipkart highlighted how the platform had helped transform local struggling businesses selling badminton racquets and sarees, a traditional dress.

381,"January 24, 2019, 05:36:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Here's Why Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Looks like a Buy Ahead of Earnings,"
 Microsoft MSFT  is scheduled to release its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, January 30, along with the likes of Facebook FB  , Alibaba BABA  , Qualcomm QCOM  , Tesla TSLA  , and other heavy hitters. So, let's see why  Microsoft stock  looks like a buy as we head into the meat o f earnings  season.  Overview  Microsoft has expanded its reach over the years beyond software and personal computing. Last quarter, MSFT captured roughly 15%  of the cloud market to come in second behind Amazon AMZN  and top IBM IBM  , Google GOOGL  , and Alibaba. The firm also saw its Xbox-driven gaming division soar 44% as its Netflix NFLX  -style Xbox Game Pass grew.  makeArticleAd();  Meanwhile, Microsoft plans to continue to expand its IoT segment and other future-looking divisions. The historic technology firm also made 15 acquisitions during the 2018 calendar year, which was highlighted by its $7.5 billion purchase of open-sourced software platform Github. Shares of Microsoft have climbed nearly 13% since Christmas along with much of the rest of the market. Overall, MSFT is up roughly 15% over the last year, which outpaces the S&P 500's 7% decline and its industry's 11% drop. MSFT closed regular trading Thursday at $106.20 a share, which marked an 8.6% downturn from its 52-week high of $116.18 a share.     Q2 Fiscal 2019 Outlook  Moving on, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for MSFT's quarterly revenues to jump 12.3% to hit $32.45 billion. This would come on top of the year-ago quarter's 12% surge, but fall short of last quarter's 19% top-line expansion. More specifically, the firm's Productivity & Business Processes unit, which features Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics CRM, is projected to see its revenues jump 12.8% from $8.953 billion to reach $10.096 billion, based on our current NFM consensus estimates. This division's revenues climbed 19% in fiscal Q1. Meanwhile, Microsoft's closely watched Intelligent Cloud revenues are projected to jump 19% to touch $9.295 billion. Intelligent Cloud surged 24% last quarter and 15% in the year-ago period. MSFT's largest business segment, More Personal Computing, is expected to see its revenues pop 7.5% to touch $13.086 billion. This would mark a downturn from last quarter's 15% jump in the division that includes Windows. At the bottom end of the income statement, MSFT's adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to climb 13.5% to reach $1.09 per share. Last quarter, the firm's adjusted EPS figure surged 36% to reach $1.14 a share.     Bottom Line  Microsoft is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment based, in large part, on its recen t earnings  estimate revision activity. Plus, MSFT is a dividend payer that looks ready for continued expansion as fellow tech giant Apple AAPL  seems poised for a slowdown. Microsoft is set to report its Q2 fiscal 2019 financial results after the closing bell on Wednesday, January 30. Make sure to check back here for our full analysis of Microsoft's actual results.

382,"January 24, 2019, 05:35:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Amazon Is Ramping Up Its Assault on Its Shipping Partners,"
  Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been slowly building up its in-house delivery   network in recent years, increasingly in-sourcing one of the most   important aspects of its operations. After unveiling the   first Prime Air (since redubbed Amazon Air) delivery plane in   2016, the company had started testing a service called   Seller Flex in late 2017, allowing third-party merchants on   Amazon to ship through Amazon's own delivery network as opposed   to third-party shippers like   FedEx    (NYSE: FDX) or   UPS    (NYSE: UPS) . The e-commerce giant is now ramping up its assault on those   shipping partners.   Image source: Amazon.makeArticleAd();  Amazon uses its favorite tactic: undercutting   The Wall Street Journal     (subscription required) reports that Amazon is actively trying to   poach customers from FedEx and UPS, hoping to entice them with   lower costs and other fees. By forgoing some of the fees -- which   can oftentimes represent over 30% of the total shipping cost --   that other carriers charge, Amazon is characteristically looking   to undercut the competition, potential losses be damned. A little   bit of red ink in pursuit of growth has rarely deterred the   e-commerce titan from pursuing disruptive ambitions. The service is being rebranded as Amazon Shipping as it   expands outside of its two initial test markets, London and Los   Angeles. Amazon told   WSJ    that it is always looking to help ""support the small and medium   businesses who sell on Amazon, including testing shipping   programs,"" suggesting that that the company isn't going after   large merchants quite yet. FedEx and UPS continue to downplay the competitive threat,   although it could be misguided to dismiss a serial disrupter like   Amazon. ""We don't see [Amazon] as a peer competitor at this point   in time,"" FedEx CEO Fred Smith   said just last month    . ""For many reasons, we think it is doubtful that will be the   case."" Amazon represents about 3% of FedEx's total revenue. Growing the fleet while keeping options open Amazon expanded its partnership with   Air Transport Services Group    (NASDAQ: ATSG) in December, leasing an additional 10   Boeing    767s, while extended its leases for 20 of those same aircraft it   was already using. That brings Amazon's total leased fleet to 50   aircraft. Of those, 30 are operated by ATSG (including via   subsidiary ABX Air), while 20 are operated by   Atlas Air    . Amazon continues to acquire ATSG warrants, signaling potential   interest in acquiring the company at some point in the future.   ATSG issued more warrants to Amazon as part of the recent deal,   allowing Amazon to acquire to up 33% of the service provider.   Amazon can secure even more warrants that would take its stake up   to 40%, should it lease up to 17 more aircraft before January   2026. The warrants have an exercise price of $21.53 per   share. Meanwhile, Amazon is also expanding its Amazon Air hub at   Chicago Rockford International Airport and building new hubs   at Fort Worth's Alliance Airport and Cincinnati/Northern   Kentucky International Airport. Growing revenue and cutting costs at the same time This is another textbook example of a company that can grow a   disruptive side-business that doesn't have to be profitable,   threatening pure-play incumbents. But Amazon has even more   strategic interest in vertical integration when it comes to   shipping, as delivery logistics are so critical to its core   operations. This isn't just about creating a new revenue stream;   it's also about cutting costs and owning that part of the value   chain. Amazon doesn't disclose shipping revenue (a portion of Prime   membership fees are allocated to shipping revenue) anymore, which   used to give investors insight into the company's   net shipping costs    , but Morgan Stanley estimates annual cost savings associated   with using Amazon Air at   around $2 billion    . The company is also at the mercy of future rate increases.   Shipping costs for the first three quarters of 2018 jumped   nearly 30% to a whopping $18.6 billion. Building a delivery network will take an incredible amount of   time and money, but Amazon has plenty of both.

383,"January 24, 2019, 04:24:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Retail-Discount Stores Outlook: Consumer Spending Key to Growth,"
makeZacksArticleAd();The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry comprises companies that offer apparel, accessories, footwear, beauty products, personal and baby care products, cleaning products, pet supplies, and food and beverage products.The companies also provide home textiles, home furnishings, housewares, toys and seasonal décor products. They sell their products through stores as well as digital channels. Some of the companies operate membership shopping warehouse clubs offering branded and private-label products in a range of merchandise categories.Let's take a look at the industry's three major themes:The industry's prospects are closely tied to the purchasing power of consumers. A robust job market and higher disposable income are working in favor of industry participants. Also, the strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players expand their customer base, which comprises lower to middle income group. Moreover, a differentiated product range in sync with customers' spending habits enables the companies to enrich the shopping experience, resulting in market share gains and higher sales per square foot.Players in the industry are steadily developing omni-channel capabilities, which include technological updates and store remodels. They are undertaking brand enhancement efforts with off-price models and innovative customer-friendly approach such as same-day delivery options. These along with a compelling store growth story at convenient locations and focus on demand-driven products lend support. Better pricing, effective inventory management, and merchandise and operational initiatives should boost revenues of the industry constituents.The companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Of late, the retail-discount space has turned highly competitive with the growing dominance of Amazon (AMZN). This has compelled a number of players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, any deleverage in SG&A rate, higher labor and occupancy costs, and increased marketing and other store-related expenses might also compress margins. Nonetheless, companies are resorting to cost containment.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects
 The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry is housed within the broader Zacks Retail - Wholesale sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #107, which places it in the top 42% of more than 250 Zacks industries.
 The group's Zacks Industry Rank , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.
 The industry's position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually becoming hopeful of this group's earnings growth. In the past year, the industry's earnings estimate for the current year has increased approximately 7.3%.
 We will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. But it's worth taking a look at the industry's shareholder returns and current valuation first.Industry vs. Broader Market
 The Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry has outperformed both the broader Retail - Wholesale Sector and the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past year.
 The stocks in this industry have collectively gained 6.4% against the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Retail - Wholesale sector's decline of 7.2% and 7%, respectively.One-Year Price Performance
 I ndustry's Current Valuation
 On the basis of forward 12-month Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing retail stocks, the industry is currently trading at 18.89 compared with the S&P 500's 16.04 and the sector's 22.48.
 Over the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 25.19X, as low as 18.39X and at the median of 21.86X, as the chart below shows.Price-to-Earnings Ratio (Past 5 Years)Bottom Line
 Certainly, discount retailers have succeeded in creating a niche despite the rising popularity of online retailers that has compelled many traditional operators to exit. This has been largely supported by investments, focus on cost savings and introduction of loyalty and marketing programs. However, costs associated with promotional activities and an aggressive pricing strategy on account of stiff competition remain deterrents.

Looking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at ETF Channel  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself. For the Invesco Russell Top 200 Equal Weight ETF (Symbol: EQWL), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $60.27 per unit.      With EQWL trading at a recent price near $51.21 per unit, that means that analysts see 17.69% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EQWL's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are EOG Resources, Inc. (Symbol: EOG), Amazon.com Inc (Symbol: AMZN), and NXP Semiconductors NV (Symbol: NXPI). Although EOG has traded at a recent price of $96.57/share, the average analyst target is 33.87% higher at $129.28/share. Similarly, AMZN has 31.78% upside from the recent share price of $1640.02 if the average analyst target price of $2161.21/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting NXPI to reach a target price of $99.20/share, which is 25.73% above the recent price of $78.90.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments?

makeZacksArticleAd();Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.CHKP is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2018 results on Jan 30.
 Notably, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 3.06%.
 In the las t report ed quarter, Check Point's earnings increased 6% year over year to $1.38, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36. The company's revenues increased 4% to $471 million and beat the consensus estimate of $466 million.
 For the fourth quarter, the company expects revenues to be between $500 million and $528 million. Non-GAAP earnings are projected in the range of $1.56 to $1.67 per share.
 For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings is pegged at $1.63, indicating 3.16% increase on a year-over-year basis. The same for revenues stands at $516.13 million, indicating a 2% rise.
 Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at Play
 Check Point is gaining traction from growing adoption of its cloud-based solutions. Continued strength in security subscription is a major catalyst behind Check Point's growth. It is witnessing a large number of subscriptions, which is expected translate into significant revenues in the quarter to be reported.
 In the last reported quarter, the company launched SandBlast Mobile 3.0 that offers threat prevention technology to enterprises, enabling employees to safely conduct business using mobile devices. This technology is expected to strengthen its cloud security capabilities.
 Check Point continues to execute on the enhancement of the Infinity architecture. The pipeline for Infinity deals remains strong. In the last reported quarter, a number of deals were closed in a variety of industries with midsized as well as large companies. This trend is expected to boost the top line.
 The company is winning new customer accounts, which is driving revenue growth. In the third quarter of 2018, the number of customers who signed deals worth $1 million or more was 58.
 Check Point is expected to benefit from its Independent Software Vendor partnership with Blackberry BB . Moreover, last November, it announced technology integration with Amazon's AMZN AWS Security Hub to improve cloud protection for its consolidated security platform, which is likely to reflect positively in the upcoming quarterly results.
 However, increased investments in sales and marketing efforts by the company, which led to a 0.4% year-over-year decline in non-GAAP operating income in the last reported quarter, is expected to keep margins under pressure.
 Moreover, the buyout of Dome9 in the last reported quarter is expected to lead to a fall of 2-4 cents in earnings per share while having no material impact on revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.

398,"January 24, 2019, 05:16:05 AM EDT",AMZN,InvestorPlace Media,International Business Machines Finally Has A Strategy That Can Drive IBM Stock,"
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) managed to beat estimates on both sales and earnings for the quarter ending in December, but that wasn't the big news from Tuesday night. The big news is we can finally understand what IBM's business is, and how it will grow. The shares of IBM stock closed at $122 ahead of the results and opened at $133 as investors digested the numbers.makeArticleAd();It was net income of $4.4 billion, or  $4.87 per share , on revenue of $21.8 billion, that beat estimates and sent IBM stock flying . Investors grabbed for a dividend of $1.57 per share that still saw yields at almost 5%, even after a 7.68% jump in the share price in pre-market trading yesterday.IBM seems to have settled on a strategy that makes sense. Calling it "" hybrid multi-cloud, "" it's built around the idea that big companies want the flexibility of using multiple cloud platforms, along with building their own for key data and applications.Blogger and tech analyst Kishore Jethanandani writing on  Futurist Lens  sees this as a huge opportunity, a market growing at 17% that should be worth  $97 billion by 2023 .Putting on the Red HatRed hats may be associated with the President of the United States these days, but IBM's turnaround began in October with its  $34 billion deal for open-source software developer  Red Hat (NYSE: RHT ).7 Stupidly Cheap Stocks to Buy NowThe timing wasn't ideal, coming at a peak in tech valuations, and the deal hasn't yet closed, but Red Hat has already transformed Big Blue's corporate image. During the quarter IBM delivered profitable growth in its cloud segment, with areas it dubs ""strategic imperatives"" now representing half its revenue.The deal also culminated the transformation of Red Hat under CEO Jim Whitehurst. What had been a provider of open source Linux software became a leader in corporate cloud services through the OpenShift container platform, which helps companies bring their existing software into clouds .IBM and Red Hat have always had a close relationship, with Big Blue executives keynoting the developer's annual technology meetings. I had personally been pounding the table for this deal since 2012 , recommending readers buy Red Hat in May , dismissing what was then IBM's strategy in July .Silver Lining in the New IBM's CloudIBM is no longer focused only on its own cloud, but on growing subscription revenue and cloud-based software services in hybrid cloud, AI, analytics and security, according to CEO Ginni Rometty.Containers let companies move data between clouds from  Amazon  (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), while maintaining compatible data stores on their own premises. IBM's cloud then becomes the glue holding corporate data together. IBM doesn't require the scale of a cloud czar to do that. Its smaller size compared with the cloud titans becomes an advantage, although its revenue is still twice that of Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL ), with a market cap that's 50% higher than IBM's, and a dividend yield that two-thirds smaller.10 Consumer Stocks to Buy for IncomeThe relative strength of Oracle's stock compared with IBM's demonstrates to just what extent IBM's problems were still fixable. IBM still has its mainframe monopoly, delivering monopoly level profits, but it has been seen only as an income stock, the value of the shares down by one-third over the last five years.Bottom Line on IBM StockRed Hat has given IBM a path toward profitable growth, and IBM has spent the last quarter creating a suite of products and services it can deliver around Red Hat's hybrid cloud solution.IBM stock has long been among the cheapest tech shares out there, but only because it wasn't growing. If it can grow, the stock becomes a real bargain, and the fourth quarter results indicate it can indeed grow.The fourth quarter of 2018 transformed IBM stock from a sell to a buy.Dana Blankenhorn  is a financial and technology journalist.

NEW DELHI/NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The United States government is concerned about India's revised e-commerce regulations and has told officials in New Delhi the policy will hinder the Indian investment plans of Amazon.com  and Walmart Inc, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.
The tussle marks the latest in a number of U.S. protests over Indian government policies which impact American companies and comes at a time when the two countries are trying to iron out other trade irritants. In 2017, the U.S. lodged a written protest against India's decision to cap medical device prices, which upset American companies. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
The policy has dealt a blow to Walmart, which just last year invested $16 billion in buying 77 percent of India's Flipkart, and Amazon, as it would force them to change their business structures in the country and raise their operational costs.
""There is a very strong undercurrent as to how this should be made a bilateral issue,"" said a Washington-based industry source aware of the companies' thinking.
""This has gone way beyond being a local (India) tussle.""
A U.S. government official earlier this month told Indian officials to protect Walmart and Flipkart's investments in the country, an Indian trade ministry official told Reuters.
The U.S. government cited ""good relations"" between the two countries and stressed that American companies should be given concessions in the larger interest of bilateral trade, but India gave a ""non-committal"" response, the source added.
But Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is unlikely to delay the revised rules or amend them in any meaningful way as he is seeking the support of the tens of millions of small retailers and traders in India ahead of a general election that must be held by May. The small firms see Walmart and Amazon as a threat to their businesses.
An Indian industry source said Walmart, Amazon and lobbying groups were coordinating efforts with the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and the local embassy to express their discontent about the policy.
The USTR did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, and Indian trade ministry spokeswoman Monideepa Mukherjee, declined to comment.
Asked about the Indian policy's implications, Walmart spokesman Greg Hitt said: ""We certainly, as you would expect, have engaged the (United States) administration on this issue."" He declined to share further details.
Amazon India said it was committed to complying with local laws but it needed ""adequate time to understand"" the policy.


GLOBAL VS LOCAL
Amazon and Walmart have both made bold bets to tap India's booming e-commerce market, which Morgan Stanley had estimated, before the latest government move would grow 30 percent a year to $200 billion in the 10 years up to 2027.
The companies have targeted a growing population of tech-savvy shoppers in India, luring them with deep discounts on everything from dishwashers to smartphones.
India's small traders and shopkeepers had for years complained that e-commerce companies were engaging in predatory pricing and hurting the businesses of brick-and-mortar retailers.
They alleged that the online retailers used their control over inventory from their affiliates to create an unfair marketplace that allowed them to sell some products at lower prices. Such arrangements would be barred under the new policy.
""We are disappointed more than surprised. It makes it harder to plan things,"" a U.S.-based Walmart source told Reuters.
""It is a serious issue. We are doing our best to work with Indian authorities and trying to explain why this is bad for business.""
The Confederation of All India Traders, which has supported tougher scrutiny of large e-commerce players, said the companies were acting ""desperate"" by pressurising the Indian government.
""Any deferment or change (in the policy) will adversely affect millions of small businesses,"" said the group's secretary general, Praveen Khandelwal.


POLITICS, DEADLINE RISK
Both Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon have requested the government to delay implementation of the policy, but India is unlikely to relent.
Indian officials have told Reuters no relief was likely as the policy was seen helping the small trader community, who form a critical voter base for Modi.
""The idea is just to win over the trading community ahead of elections and on that point the government will not budge from the deadline,"" a second Indian trade ministry official said.
At stake are big ticket investments. When Walmart bought Flipkart last year, it said the decision underscored its ""long-term commitment to India"".
Amazon has committed to investing $5.5 billion in the country and Modi has in recent years met its founder Jeff Bezos multiple times. In 2017, Bezos said he was ""excited to keep investing and growing"" in the country.
That investment climate has turned sour with sudden policy changes. Prasanto Roy, a New Delhi-based consultant who closely tracks India's technology policy landscape, said the government should provide stable policies to attract investment.
""You can't change policies overnight without consultation and tell companies who have invested billions to go fly a kite,"" Roy said.

400,"January 24, 2019, 02:07:43 AM EDT",AMZN,Kiplinger,The 11 Hottest IPOs to Watch For in 2019,"
The market for initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2018 saw 190 companies take the plunge, raising $47 billion in collective proceeds. That IPO tally was higher than the 160 offerings in 2017, and far better than the 105 in 2016.That's the good news. The bad news is that activity came to a grinding halt in the final two months of the year. IPO pricings fell 66% after Nov. 1, throwing cold water all over the market for IPOs heading into 2019.makeArticleAd();""The fact that the market is shaky right now, if it stays that way, we will see discounts to get deals done. It is amazing Tencent (Music) pulled off its IPO,"" Kathleen Smith, principal at IPO specialist Renaissance Capital, told CNBC in mid-December. She also said the online music platform priced at the bottom of its $13-15 range, ""and maybe it should have priced below its range, based on how it is trading.""On top of that, the partial federal government shutdown could delay some of the most hotly anticipated IPOs on investors' watch lists in 2019. That's because many workers that review such documents haven't been allowed back to their desks.Despite all this, 2019 could be a big year for initial public offerings. While the total number could be down, there are some potentially explosive offerings on the horizon, and a couple of CEOs have recently affirmed that their IPOs still are on track.Here, we look at the 11 hottest IPOs to watch for in 2019. In some cases, the companies have filed official paperwork for an offering. In others, experts are anticipating a 2019 offering based on company statements or actions.SEE ALSO: The 25 Biggest U.S. IPOs of All TimeUber TechnologiesPotential valuation: $120 billionUber, which filed its paperwork in December, is arguably the most anticipated IPO to watch in 2019, and it could also be the year's most prominent and most valuable.The biggest problem Uber will have going public in 2019 isn't that it's an unknown commodity, but rather that the lengthy bull market appears to be coming to an end at precisely the same time as the U.S. economy is softening. These aren't great selling features for any IPO, let alone one that could value the ride-sharing business at $120 billion.It has taken Uber a decade to get from fledgling startup to global ride-sharing powerhouse with 75 million riders, 3 million drivers and an estimated 15 million trips completed daily. Over the years, it has raised more than $24 billion in funding. But although the company had little problem finding private investors, the liquidity provided by an IPO is attractive.""The public market provides greater liquidity,"" Matt Pencek, director of IPO consulting firm MorganFranklin Consulting, recently told Vox. ""The difference between public and private is like owning a home but being told you have to wait for a buyer to come to you, or that you can only sell your home to a few people every few years.""Uber is a company with a troubled past that needs an IPO home run to erase some of the bad memories. We'll know soon enough if it succeeds.SEE ALSO: The 12 Best Tech Stocks for a 2019 RecoveryPalantir TechnologiesPotential valuation: $41 billionPalantir Technologies could be 2019's most secretive entrant in the IPO sweepstakes.Palantir, co-founded by Peter Thiel - who co-founded PayPal ( PYPL ) and was an early investor in Facebook ( FB ) - could be ready to take the long walk down the IPO runway.Palantir uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help organizations, many of them in law enforcement, analyze and understand large quantities of data. The company was founded in 2004 by CEO Alex Karp, Thiel - Karp's Stanford Law School classmate - Nathan Gettings, Joe Lonsdale and Stephen Cohen.Palantir isn't without a little controversy. In a recent Wall Street Journal profile of Karp, the newspaper called the CEO a ""self-described socialist,"" though that runs in complete contrast to the company's work, which has included analyzing data for predictive policing programs. (A Rand Corporation study of such programs in Chicago found they often led to the increased surveillance and arrest of people of color.)According to reports in September, Palantir looked to favor Morgan Stanley to be its top adviser, looking out to late 2019 or early 2020 for its offering. Morgan Stanley helped the company find private investors, and its understanding of government-backed entities makes it a natural choice. However, in November 2018, Bloomberg reported that Palantir was bickering with Morgan Stanley over its valuation of the company.Karp did say recently, however, that he doesn't expect the government shutdown to affect his company's IPO plans.SEE ALSO: 11 Great Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next DecadeAirbnbPotential valuation: $31 billionHow do you know a private company is thinking of going public? It hires a chief financial officer with public company experience.So, when Airbnb announced Nov. 26 that it had hired Dave Stephenson as its CFO after a 10-month search, you just knew the IPO speculation would heat up. Stephenson, who spent 17 years at Amazon.com ( AMZN ), was most recently VP and CFO of Worldwide Consumer Organization, Amazon's unit responsible for all its global website sales. He also helped integrate both the Zappos and Whole Foods acquisitions.""Dave is one of the best financial operators in the world and there's no one better prepared to serve as our CFO,"" Airbnb CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky said in a November statement. ""Dave will be Airbnb's quarterback for long-term growth, driving us to be even more efficient and leverage what makes Airbnb unique to create new businesses and continue to expand.""Another indication Airbnb is laying the groundwork for a 2019 IPO? It revealed some of its financial numbers for the very first time in mid-November. For example, in the third quarter, it generated more than $1 billion in revenue for the first time. In 2017, it made $100 million from $2.6 billion in revenue. Airbnb expects to deliver a second consecutive year of EBITDA profitability in 2018.One last hint: The company reportedly held talks to possibly acquire hotel-inventory seller Hotel Tonight. Those talks ended up bearing no fruit but could indicate that Airbnb is looking for ways to entice potential IPO investors.SEE ALSO: The 19 Best ETFs for a Prosperous 2019LyftPotential valuation: $15 billion-$30 billionWhether it's the competition between Lyft and Uber to get the most users for its ride-sharing apps or the race to get to the IPO finish line first, both companies are determined to be the ultimate winner. Lyft did beat Uber in one respect already, however, confidentially filing its paperwork Dec. 6 - a day before Uber did.Uber currently has a 60% market share compared to 23% for Lyft, according to a Raymond James survey of 1,062 Americans. However, that same study found that Lyft drivers were friendlier and customers more loyal. ""While Lyft trails Uber in share, it does have a highly engaged user base - we found that Lyft users actually use the service more frequently than Uber users,"" the report said.That at least suggests Lyft might end up being the more popular IPO.Interestingly, the report also found that only 58% of respondents have used a ride-hailing app, which suggests both Lyft and Uber should be able to continue growing at a double-digit pace.What should attract investors to Lyft relative to Uber is that it has been growing faster. Between 2014-17, Lyft increased revenues by 223% compounded annually, compared to 146% for Uber.""In the long run, Uber might take the lion's share of capital in the category,"" Duncan Davidson, the co-founder of Bullpen Capital, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm, told Yahoo Finance in November. ""But if I was a normal investor I'd go into Lyft ... there's more upside being smaller.""SEE ALSO: 20 Top Stock Picks the Analysts Love for 2019PinterestPotential valuation: $12.3 billionPinterest chose to bring in a heavy hitter to handle the company's investor relations as it gears up for a 2019 IPO, hiring Jane Penner in November.Penner was the head of investor relations at Alibaba ( BABA ) when it raised $25 billion in its 2014 initial public offering. Before her work at Alibaba, she was the head of investor relations at a little company called Google, now known as Alphabet ( GOOGL ).You don't hire someone of Penner's caliber if you're not getting ready for an IPO.A further indication the company is preparing to raise money in the public markets: It hired Andréa Mallard as the company's chief marketing officer in November. Mallard is the former CMO of Athleta, Gap's ( GPS ) growth brand.Pinterest generated $500 million in revenue in 2017 and was expected to almost double that in 2018. Pinterest, which has become the social media app of choice for people looking to find and shop for products, now has 250 million users, 25% higher than a year earlier.It could be one of the earlier IPOs to watch on this list - a Dec. 19 Wall Street Journal report said Pinterest's offering could come as soon as April, citing people familiar with the company's plans.SEE ALSO: The 25 Best S&P 500 Stocks of the Past 50 YearsInstacartPotential valuation: $8 billionOnce Amazon bought Whole Foods in June 2017, it was only a matter of time before Instacart's partnership with the premium grocery store, which began in 2014 with so much promise, was destined to end. In December, Instacart officially announced the end of its partnership, putting 350 shoppers (the people who pick the products off the Whole Foods shelves) out of work while another 1,000 will be offered shopping roles at some of its other partners including Publix and Albertsons.The company was founded in 2012 by CEO Apoorva Mehta, who worked at Amazon between 2008-10. And Mehta sees an IPO in the company's future despite the Whole Foods setback.""An IPO is definitely on the horizon for us,"" Mehta recently told CNN Business. ""As we think about building a long-term company, we think being a public company allows us to do that in the best possible way.""This past November, Instacart raised $271 million in funding, valuing the six-year-old company at $8 billion. An early investor in the grocery delivery startup was Sequoia Capital, whose successful investments include Dropbox ( DBX ) and Airbnb; more importantly, it was an early investor in WebVan, a grocery delivery service that failed because it grew too fast.A lot has to happen for Instacart to do an IPO in 2019. If it does, expect it to price in the final quarter of the year.SEE ALSO: The 5 Best Investments You Can Make in 2019CrowdStrikePotential valuation: $3 billionAlthough cybersecurity software maker CrowdStrike has hired Goldman Sachs to get it ready for an IPO in the first half of 2019, it's possible that the company sells itself to a more significant player before even getting to the starting line.Earlier in 2018, CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz appeared on CNBC to talk about his company's place on the network's Disruptor 50 list. He wasn't shy, suggesting someone like Amazon.com could be very interested in its cloud-based endpoint security platform, which protects remote devices from being accessed by a third party.""(Amazon) is a big partner,"" Kurtz stated May 24. ""We actually supply some of the intelligence for some of the services behind Amazon, which is their GuardDuty service, so it's worked out quite well so far.""A recent example of a company selling just before going public is Qualtrics, which sold itself to SAP SE ( SAP ) in November for $8 billion after filing for an IPO in October.

Because it makes good business sense.""We're so big that the industry can't change if we don't lead,"" Tyson CEO Tom Hayes said in an August interview.""We want to actively disrupt ourselves. We don't want to be Kodak.""The second reason investors have heard about Beyond Meat is the incredible success of its meatless burger with various restaurant chains across the country, including TGI Friday's, Twin Peaks, Veggie Grill and many more.""It's only the beginning,"" Caroline Bushnell, the Good Food Institute's senior marketing manager, said in December. ""We're in the early stage of a major shift. Companies are realizing that the market for plant-based meat isn't just vegans or vegetarians, it's meat-eaters.""Beyond Meat filed in November 2018 and expects to price its shares very early in 2019. The star power and company potential could result in an oversubscribed IPO.SEE ALSO: 7 ""Strong Buy"" Stocks to Buy With 30%-Plus UpsideGores MetropoulosPotential valuation: $469 millionGores Metropoulos - one of the few non-tech IPOs on this list - is a ""blank check"" company formed between Alec Gores, CEO of Los Angeles-based private equity firm The Gores Group, and Dean Metropoulos, the man behind the revival of Hostess Brands ( TWNK ).If you're not familiar with blank check companies, also known as SPACs, they bring together management with particular expertise - in this case, it's consumer products and services - to raise a set amount of money it uses to acquire an operating company in this field.By the rules, it must put the funds raised, less a small amount, to use in the search and due diligence process in a trust account that pays interest. Also, it must complete an acquisition within 24 months of the offering's closing. If they don't, the funds are returned to investors with interest.Blank check companies, as investments, became popular with hedge fund managers in 2008 when the markets were tanking because they provided an excellent place to park cash in a down market.Generally, a blank check company is only as good as the management team involved. With Gores and Metropoulos leading the way, it is likely they will get an acquisition done before the end of the 24 months.The company filed Dec. 11, with plans to raise $375 million (37.5 million units at a price of $10).SEE ALSO: The 25 Best Blue-Chip Stocks for 2019 (According to Hedge Funds)Virgin Trains USAPotential valuation: N/AWhile Virgin Trains USA could be the most speculative of the 2019 IPOs mentioned in this article, the mere fact that Richard Branson's name is attached to the November filing should be enough to pull in a few investors.Virgin Trains USA, formerly known as Brightline, operates train service between Miami and West Palm Beach with construction underway to expand service to Orlando and Tampa.In November, it announced a partnership with Virgin Enterprises - which operates train service in the U.K. and had 38 million passenger trips in its latest fiscal year - providing the company with an experienced partner for growing its business outside of Florida. As part of the partnership, Brightline was renamed Virgin Trains USA, which should attract more customers to its Miami to Palm Beach service.In the future, Virgin Trains USA seeks to add routes of 200 to 300 miles that are too short to fly and too long to drive. Up first is a route between Victorville (in southern California) and Las Vegas. Other potential routes include Portland to Vancouver, Dallas to Houston, and Atlanta to Charlotte.Building new passenger rail lines isn't cheap. For example, the expected cost of the Las Vegas route is $3.6 billion. Investors can expect operating losses for several years, if not a decade or more. But if you believe in rail travel being a solution to America's car problem, Virgin Trains USA's IPO could be just the ticket.The IPO is expected to raise $100 million, but so far, there is no reliable estimate on company valuation.SEE ALSO: 20 Expert Market Outlooks for 2019SlackPotential valuation: $10 billionThe workplace messaging app Slack likely is going public in 2019, though Bloomberg reported this year that it's planning to list its shares directly with investors, rather than using an underwriting syndicate to find the buyers. What's interesting is that Bloomberg also reported in December 2018 that Slack had hired Goldman Sachs to lead its underwriting team - a move that, at the time, would've suggested a traditional IPO.The consensus is that enterprise startups make bad candidates for direct listings because not enough investors are aware of the company's products or services because they're sold to other companies and not the general public. But many people have used Slack's messaging app - it has 8 million daily active users - and doesn't really need a primer on what the company does or why its shares are worth owning.Whenever Slack goes public, it will have its hands full with some much larger competitors including Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Google. It also will have to replace its chief product officer, as CPO April Underwood recently announced she would step down to focus on her investment firm.Is a direct listing the best route? Spotify ( SPOT ) at least provides a test case. It sold more than 177 million shares to the public and opened at $165.90, well above the $132 reference price set by the New York Stock Exchange. But its stock has since come back to earth, trading around that $132 mark.SEE ALSO: Value Added: 7 Top Stocks for 2019

 (RTTNews.com) - Amazon Canada, affiliated to Amazon ( AMZN ), announced Thursday that it has introduced a monthly membership option for Prime Student members. At $3.99, the monthly option offers Prime Student members in Canada an alternative to the existing annual membership, which is $39.

The company noted that eligible students only need to provide their school email address to begin enjoying the benefits of Prime Student membership for six months at no cost by visiting amazon.ca/joinstudent.
Following the trial, students now have the option to continue their membership for $3.99 per month on the new monthly plan or for just $39 per year, less than half the cost of an annual Amazon Prime membership.

makeZacksArticleAd();Apple AAPL shocked Wall Street when it lowered its quarterly guidance in early January, citing a major slowdown in China and subdued iPhone sales. Now, as Q4 earnings season starts to ramp up, let's see what investors should expect from Apple's fiscal Q1 financial results that are due out Tuesday, January 29 (also read: Earnings Growth Slowing Down ).OverviewApple lowered its fiscal Q1 2019 revenue guidance for the first time in over 15 years to roughly $84 billion, which marked a $5 billion downturn from the low-end of its previous holiday quarter outlook that called for between $89 billion and $93 billion. CEO Tim Cook pointed directly to slower sales in emerging markets, mostly Greater China, as well as fewer iPhone upgrades, as the two main reasons for Apple's lowered quarterly outlook.
 Apple's announcement worried global market s because it signaled that China's economy could be headed in the wrong direction. These fears were seemingly confirmed after reports this week showed that China's economy hit its slowest growth pace since 1990 as the trade war continues. Chinese e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba's BABA quarterly estimates also highlight the slowdown (also read: What to Expect from Alibaba Earnings Amid Chinese Economic Slowdown ).Apple stock closed regular trading Wednesday at $153.92 a share, which marked a roughly 34% downturn from its 52-week high of $233.47. With all that said, we should quickly note that Apple stock has outpaced Facebook FB , Google GOOGL , and the S&P 500 over the last three years, despite falling short of fellow FAANG peers Netflix NFLX and Amazon AMZN .Fiscal Q1 OutlookApple's Q1 2019 revenues are projected to slip 4.75% from the year-ago period to hit $84.1 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Apple's revenues surge 20% in Q4 and 13% in Q1 2018. At the bottom end of the income statement, the company's adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to pop 7.2%.iPhoneAs investors might have feared, Apple's quarterly iPhone revenues are projected to fall roughly 15% from $61.576 billion to hit $52.264 billion, based on our current NFM estimate. Meanwhile, iPhone unit sales are expected to fall by a similar percentage from 77.316 million in Q1 2018 to 65.425 million.Investors should note that 2019 will be a year of hard comparisons for Apple since every quarter's growth will now be measured against quarters that already included the firm's higher-priced new iPhones. Last quarter, iPhone revenues surged 29%, while iPhone unit sales came in flat from the year-ago period.ServicesMoving on, let's see what investors should expect from Apple services unit, which has been an important growth driver and will remain a closely watched metric on Wall Street. Apple's services revenues are projected to surge over 27% from $8.471 billion to reach $10.819 billion this quarter, based on our current NFM estimates. This would top last quarter's 17% expansion, Q1 2018's 18% climb, and the 25.5% average growth over the trailing six quarters.Apple's services division has expanded in recent years on the back of Apple Pay, Apple Music, among other units. This unit might even soon include Apple's new streaming TV service that is expected to launch sometime over the next year to challenge Netflix, Amazon, Disney DIS , and AT&T T .Greater ChinaIn China, Apple's quarterly revenues are projected to slip from $17.956 billion in the year-ago quarter to $17.129 billion, which would mark an approximately 4.5% downturn. Sales in Greater China jumped 16% last quarter and 11% in Q1 2018. We should note that the world's second-largest economy has accounted for 18% of Apple's revenues in each of the last two quarters.Wall Street will constantly monitor Apple's Chinese revenues, which could continue to fade amid the country's slowing economy. Plus, Apple has always faced a ton of competition from lower-cost smartphone makers.Other ProductsLastly, let's see what to expect from Apple's ""other products"" revenues, which includes Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, and more. The firm's other products unit is projected to soar roughly 38% from $5.489 billion in the year-ago quarter to hit $7.548 billion. This would top Q1 2018's 36%, Q4's 31%, and the trailing six quarters' 33.5% average.Apple is scheduled to release its Q1 fiscal 2019 financial results after the closing bell on Tuesday, January 29.

makeZacksArticleAd();ViacomVIAB recently reached an agreement to buy Pluto TV, a free ad-supported streaming service in the United States, in an all-cash deal worth $340 million.
 Pluto TV, launched in 2013 has more than 100 channels that showcase content across categories like movies, sports, comedy, gaming, lifestyle and TV shows, among others. Additionally, Pluto TV's partnerships with more than 130 media houses, film and TV studios and digital content providers help put forth a variety of content.
 Pluto TV currently has more than 12 million monthly active users. Moreover, the service can be accessed over a variety of platforms including Roku, Chromecast, Amazon AMZN Fire TV, Samsung TV and Apple TV to name a few. Further, the service will soon be available on more devices owing to new distribution deals.
 Notably, the deal is expected to be closed by the first quarter of 2019 and Pluto TV will operate as an independent subsidiary of Viacom.Viacom Inc. Revenue (TTM)Viacom Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Viacom Inc. QuoteAcquisition to Aid User and Ad Growth
 Viacom's acquisition of Pluto TV is the perfect opportunity for the company to attract new users leveraging its reach in more than 180 countries. Although the company does not intend to pull content from its pay-TV offerings, Viacom Digital Studios' content will be made available on the free service. Digital Studios, launched in April 2018, will provide original and on-demand content from ""BET, Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon.""
 Additionally, Viacom is likely to create a separate ""Spanish language offering"" for Pluto TV users in the near term, given Viacom International Studios' (VIS) strong library from both the U.S. and Latin American markets.
 Moreover, Viacom looks to use Pluto TV to attract and retain users for its existing subscription-based services including Noggin and Comedy Central Now. Further, the company is looking to use the free ad-supported service to attract advertisers and provide target-based ads thereby expanding its advertising revenues.Competition Woes Remain
 Netflix NFLX , which has a loyal subscriber base and strong content portfolio, is currently the dominant player in the market. Notably, about 71% of the users wish to continue with Netflix subscription even after the recent price hike.
 The fast-growing streaming market, which is expected to reach $124.57 billion by 2025 per Grand View Research, is attracting companies looking to provide both paid and free services. Companies like Disney, Apple and AT & T will launch a paid service in 2019, whereas Sinclair Broadcast SBGI , Amazon and Comcast launched/in the process of launching a free streaming service.
 We expect competition in the streaming market to intensify. This may not bode well for Viacom, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

By Mike Spector and Liana B. Baker
Jan 23 (Reuters) - Things Remembered Inc, a U.S. retailer that sells engraved gifts and keepsakes, is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection in the coming days and shutter most of its roughly 400 stores, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The preparations show how a debt restructuring that Things Remembered underwent in 2016 was not enough to spare it from the wave of bankruptcies sweeping the brick-and-mortar retail sector amid the growing popularity of online shopping.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
The closely-held retailer, which has roughly $120 million of debt and faces a cash crunch, is owned by a consortium of investors including private-equity giant KKR & Co Inc. KKR was a lender alongside other financial firms that forgave debt in exchange for ownership of the struggling chain in 2016.
Representatives for Things Remembered and KKR declined to comment.
Things Remembered is preparing severance payments and outplacement services for employees likely to lose jobs when the company closes stores, the sources added.
Things Remembered hired investment bank Miller Buckfire & Co, owned by Stifel Financial Corp, in recent weeks in part to seek buyers for assets, the sources said. Things Remembered has tapped restructuring lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis LLP to prepare its bankruptcy filing, the sources said.
A Stifel representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a Kirkland spokesman had no immediate comment.
Since its debt restructuring in 2016, Things Remembered has installed a new chief executive and focused on boosting its online presence to address the seismic shift of consumers away from physical stores. The company in September launched a presence on Amazon.com Inc's  website that offered customers the option to ""engrave and embroider items in a matter of clicks.""
Nevertheless, Things Remembered has struggled to compete in the modern era of e-commerce, which has prompted longtime stalwarts such as Toys 'R' Us Inc and Sears Holdings Corp to seek bankruptcy protection.

CHKP  recently unveiled hyperscale network security solution- Check Point Maestro - at the annual event of CPX360 held in Bangkok.  makeArticleAd();  The new solution will enable businesses to expand the existing security tools to hyperscale capacity, allowing the same to experience cloud level security.    The new architecture facilitates quick expansion of a single gateway to the capacity and performance capability of 52 gateways, enabling a massive Terabit/second firewall throughput. This helps organizations support 5G networks' high data rates and ultra-low latency.    Gil Shwed, CEO, Check Point, was quoted saying:""Gen VI of security will see nano-scale software agents placed on every type of device or cloud platform, connected in real time with an intelligent control system that can predict, detect and prevent attacks.  This will enable us to secure everything from individual IoT devices to hyperscale networks seamlessly, eliminating weak links and protecting our future.""   Robust Demand for Cybersecurity Solutions    With the growing use of AI-driven technology to aid industries in digital transformation journey, the incidents of ""smart attacks"" are also on the rise. In 2019, there is a possibility of cyber criminals using malicious chatbots to interact with potential victims and extract private information out of them.    Moreover, the ongoing year might also witnessa surge in cyber warfare, given terrorist and cyber espionage groups' widespread access to advanced technology. In fact, the first data breach of 2019 was already reported at the beginning of this month where an unauthorised third party downloaded a directory, stealing details of about 30,000 Australian civil servants.

418,"January 23, 2019, 09:18:35 AM EDT",AMZN,InvestorPlace Media,The Best Way to Trade the SPY ETF or QQQ ETF Today,"
InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsRegardless of whether you believe today's headline drivers, on the price chart both the S&P 500  and Nasdaq 100  are in position for traders to profit - first as bears, then as bulls using the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: SPY ) and PowerShares QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ ).makeArticleAd();Let me explain.Some might be thinking, ""what just happened?"" following Tuesday's rude 1.35% decline in the SPY ETF and 2% drop in QQQ to start an abbreviated workweek after four straight weeks of uplifting price behavior from the broader market.According to the financial mouthpieces, and despite earnings season being upon us, the decline in the SPY and QQQ ETF's had nothing to do with potential warnings from heavyweights like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) or Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). Nope. Four letter tickers weren't the bad guys Tuesday.Instead, the blame game for the broader market's weakness was directed at rekindled fears of a global recession following a weaker outlook for economic growth in 2019 courtesy of the International Monetary Fund. But that's not all.10 Consumer Stocks to Buy for IncomeReignited trade war worries tied to a Financial Times story didn't help the SPY ETF or QQQ ETF either. And investors showed some increased irritation following another weekend and the seemingly insurmountable wall dividing Congress and its inability to reach an agreement.So, what might tomorrow's headlines read? I'm uncertain, but in reading the price charts the environment looks ripe for shorting the market today.SPY ETF Daily ChartFor all intents and purposes, going long or short the SPY ETF or QQQ is an interchangeable position. The tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 might deliver modestly more price volatility, but the correlation between the two is undeniable, except for maybe an algorithmic high frequency trader. Given the technical stickiness, I've chosen to go with the SPY ETF to keep from essentially repeating myself with the NASDAQ 100 and wasting perfectly good ink.Looking above at the daily chart of SPY, Tuesday's price action has confirmed an overbought lower-high pivot following the market's V-bottom pattern, which began almost one month ago. The implications are bearish, at least in the short-term.The fact that shares have rallied into a price band of fairly staunch-looking resistance adds to the case for establishing a short position in the SPY ETF. The area from about $165.50 to $171.50 contains the 200-day simple moving average, a couple Fibonacci levels, as well as downtrend resistance.For traders agreeable with today's bear case, shorting the SPY ETF and using either a stop above Friday's doji topping candlestick or a looser exit above zone resistance with smaller position sizing, makes sense.7 Stupidly Cheap Stocks to Buy NowThe first target for profit-taking and buying back the SPY would be $155. That's roughly a 50% retracement from this past month's rally. It would also be a first smart step toward securing a favorable risk-to-reward ratio for the position. Another reason I'd be willing to begin covering the S&P 500 proxy at $155 is that the last time shares traded at this price level, the market triggered a bullish follow-through day and I suspect there'd be some strong support for the SPY ETF.The follow-through day is a time-tested pattern widely used by many intermediate-term investors. And on Jan. 4 this market indicator signaled a potential end to December's short-lived bear. This time could prove different of course and the FTD could simply fail. But given we're starting off short a well-positioned SPY ETF after an extended rally well-removed from December's doom and gloom, I'd say things are looking up already for this trader.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler's management do not currently own positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

419,"January 23, 2019, 09:08:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,KLA-Tencor (KLAC) to Post Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?,"
  KLA-Tencor Corporation KLAC  is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jan 29. The company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with average of 8.03%. Moreover, KLA-Tenor delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.82% in the las t report  ed quarter. Earnings of $2.46 per share increased 36.7% from the year-ago quarter and 10.8% sequentially. Revenues also increased 12.8% year over year to $1.09 billion, driven by rising demand for the company's key products and strong shipments. For second-quarter fiscal 2019, KLA-Tenor expects revenues between $1.03 billion and $1.11 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected in the range of $2.02-$2.34 per share. Notably, the company's shares have lost 19.7% in the past year compared with its industry  's decline of 26.2%.         Strong Product Portfolio - A Key Catalyst  KLA-Tenor's robust product portfolio will continue to cater to the increasing demand for wafer products. Moreover, the company is expected to witness improved end-market results, especially in China. Further, the addition of new capacity by wafer manufacturers bodes well, given increasing demand for its new wafer products. Additionally, the company's strong efforts in bringing EUV lithography technology to the market via collaborating with every EUV customer remain a positive.  Shipment Forecast  Shipments in the fiscal first quarter of $1.01 billion were at the high end of the company's guided range of $935 million to $1.015 billion, driven by strength in memory. For second-quarter fiscal 2019, KLA-Tenor expects shipments within $985 million to $1.065 billion.  What Our Model Says  According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP  . The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .  Earnings ESP:  KLA-Tenor has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.  Zacks Rank:  It currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. Hence, KLA-Tenor is unlikely to beat estimates this earnings season.

421,"January 23, 2019, 08:36:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Refranchising Efforts to Aid McDonald's (MCD) Q4 Earnings,"
  McDonald's Corporation MCD  is set to report fourth-quarter 2018 financial numbers on Jan 30, before the opening bell. We believe that the company's refranchising initiatives are likely to have boosted earnings in the fourth quarter, even though it has the possibility of hurting revenues in the quarter. However, McDonald's efforts to strengthen its position through various sales-building initiatives, along with an increased focus on franchising, posit the company for growth. Backed by better-than-expected earnings for 17 consecutive quarters, shares of McDonald's have gained 4.8% in the past year, outperforming the industry  's 3.6% growth. Let us find out how the company's top and bottom lines will shape up in fourth-quarter results.   makeArticleAd();     Top-Line Downtrend to Continue  McDonald's declining revenues have been weighing on the company's overall performance for quite some time. In the third quarter of 2018, its revenues declined 7% year over year, following 12% and 9% fall in the second and first quarters of 2018, respectively. Overall, revenues declined 9% year over year in the first nine months of 2018. This trend is likely to have continued in the fourth quarter as well. Further, the top line declined 11.4%, 13%, 7%, and 4.7% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of 2017, respectively. This downturn reflects the impact of the company's refranchising initiatives. During the las t report  ed quarter, company-operated restaurants' revenues declined 18% year over year to $2,511 million. However, the same at franchise-operated restaurants improved 6% to $2,858.4 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for company-operated restaurants' revenues in the fourth quarter marks a 10.5% year-over-year decline while franchise revenues are likely to increase 4.8% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate pegs net revenues at $5.2 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting a 3.4% fall from the prior-year quarter.  Bottom Line Likely to Improve  McDonald's earnings in the fourth quarter are likely to improve on a year-over-year basis. In fact, in the first nine months of 2018, earnings grew 4% year over year. Although refranchising initiatives are hurting the company's top line, it is facilitating earnings growth. Management's re-franchising strategy involves a shift toward a higher percentage of franchised restaurants. The reduction in ownership weighs on near-term revenues as it replaces company-operated sales by franchised sales. Subsequently, the consensus estimate pegs fourth-quarter earnings at $1.89, reflecting a 10.5% increase from the fourth quarter of 2017.  What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?  Our proven model does not show that McDonald's is likely to bea t earnings  estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both - a positive  Earnings ESP   and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter  . McDonald's has an Earnings ESP of -0.73%. Although the company's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

424,"January 23, 2019, 08:16:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Is MercadoLibre a Buy?,"
 South America-based   MercadoLibre    (NASDAQ: MELI) might be best thought of as an integrated   ecosystem of e-commerce services operating within many Latin   American markets. This ecosystem includes a marketplace platform   where third-party sellers can list products for sale, a digital   payments platform, virtual classifieds, a marketing and   advertising platform, and a logistics and delivery system. In   Argentina, MercadoLibre has even launched an asset management   platform. The company is obviously seeing a good deal of success,   and based on web traffic, it is the e-commerce leader in   Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico,   Peru, and Uruguay. More than most domestic companies, MercadoLibre is besieged by   competitive and geopolitical risks unique to the regions in which   it operates, while simultaneously presented with enormous   opportunities due to those same regions' underdeveloped markets.   As these competing thoughts take turns capturing investors'   imaginations, Mercado's stock price has been known to fluctuate   wildly. From last March to Christmas Eve, the stock price plunged   38%, only to climb 34% from its holiday lows to the present day.   With the stock still down about 15% from its all-time highs,   let's take a closer look to determine if this Latin American   e-commerce company might be a good fit for your portfolio.   MercadoLibre's mobile point-of-sale solutions division is     quickly becoming one of MercadoPago's fastest-growing segments,     growing 636% year over year, and representing almost half of     MercadoPago's off-platform payment volume. Image source: Getty     Images.makeArticleAd();  Crunching the numbers In the company's 2018 third quarter, revenue rose to $355.3   million, an incredible 58.3% increase year over year. This   top-line growth was spurred by growth in its online marketplace,   which facilitated the sale of 83.5 million products, a 12.5%   increase over 2017's third quarter. Meanwhile, gross merchandise   volume (GMV) grew to nearly $3 billion, a 27.9% increase (both   growth rates adjusted to make foreign exchange neutral). Investors found little cause for concern in Mercado's growth   or revenue but, rather, in its increasing costs and disappearing   earnings. Total operating expenses increased almost 22% to $180.7   million, while earnings per share (EPS) came in at a loss -- yes,   a loss -- of -$0.23. That's down from a positive EPS of $0.63 in   2017's third quarter. How can a once-profitable company show so   much growth but still see earnings decline at such a drastic   rate? What's behind this seemingly contradictory tale told by the   company's latest quarterly results? Causes for concern MercadoLibre investors certainly endured a turbulent year in   2018, with a number of events taking their collective pound of   flesh from its profitability. In December 2017, MercadoLibre   decided to   deconsolidate    its operations in Venezuela. In the company's 2017 fourth-quarter   conference call, CFO Pedro Arnt explained this decision, stating,   ""We have determined that we no longer have full accounting   control of our subsidiaries in that country as a result of   Venezuela's recent selective default determination, of   increasingly restrictive exchange controls, sanctions on   government officials, and other operating restrictions that have   hindered materially our ability to make key financial decisions   for that market."" The loss of its Venezuelan market obviously stung, but was   hardly life-threatening. For instance, without the impact of   Venezuela, MercadoLibre's GMV would have increased by 38%, not   28%, in its most recent quarter. However, the move signified   something more than just the loss of one of Mercado's markets; it   underlined the geopolitical instability in which the company must   operate. The company also saw growth in the number of items sold in   Brazil, due to flat shipping fees added to orders under a   predetermined amount. Arnt admitted this move was   ""self-inflicted"" in the company's 2018 Q3   conference call    , but said it ""comes with the intended benefit of growing average   ticket levels, that drive the improved economics for our free   shipping program that we were able to deliver during the   quarter."" Finally, MercadoLibre is seeing an   increased interest    in Brazil from   Amazon.com, Inc    (NASDAQ: AMZN) , whose presence is often reason enough to send   skittish investors toward the exits. Yet with Amazon having sold   books in Brazil for nearly six years, and electronics and other   assorted products since late 2017, MercadoLibre is still showing   strong growth    in the region. Reasons for optimism Despite these concerns, none of which should be taken lightly,   MercadoLibre is a company investing heavily in growth, an action   that often leads to volatility and an immediate hit in earnings.   With the company having many irons in the fire, these investments   seem to be paying off. Investors should consider the growth being   experienced in the company's other divisions, beyond its core   marketplace business. . MercadoPago is a   digital payments solution    that is fully integrated with Mercado's checkout process, so   users can pay quickly and securely online or via its app, a   payments feature that is rarer in Latin America's developing   markets than consumers elsewhere are used to. In the company's Q3   conference call, Arnt discussed the evolution of MercadoPago's   digital wallet capabilities :  Through the MercadoPago wallet, an individual can set up our     mobile wallet within minutes and be able to send peer-to-peer     payments, top up his mobile device, pay for utilities, store     money, and pay physical world merchants via our growing QR     payment network. As we continue to build greater ubiquity and     add more usage cases to our two-sided network, total payment     volume from the mobile wallet on an FX-neutral basis, should     also continue to grow triple digits year-on-year in Brazil,     Argentina, and Mexico as it did during the third quarter of     2018.  MercadoEnvios, the delivery and logistics platform for sellers   in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, is also making   strides in performance and growth. Items shipped through the   platform grew to 54.3 million, a 30.2% increase year over year.   This growth could be the result of the platform's growing   capability to deliver items within 48 hours of being ordered, a   much more difficult feat in some South American regions than in   the U.S. In Q3, the items shipped within this time frame rose 15%   over 2017's third quarter, with particular success being seen in   Mexico, where 80% of all merchandise is being delivered within   the time frame. The true value of MercadoLibre In many ways, MercadoLibre reminds me of Amazon or   Alphabet     in that there are so many moving parts it is hard for   individual investors to keep track of them all. But this is   something I believe more investors should look for in the   companies they invest in.

More than most domestic companies, MercadoLibre is besieged by   competitive and geopolitical risks unique to the regions in which   it operates, while simultaneously presented with enormous   opportunities due to those same regions' underdeveloped markets.
Image source: Getty     Images.makeArticleAd();  Crunching the numbers In the company's 2018 third quarter, revenue rose to $355.3   million, an incredible 58.3% increase year over year.
In the company's 2017 fourth-quarter   conference call, CFO Pedro Arnt explained this decision, stating,   ""We have determined that we no longer have full accounting   control of our subsidiaries in that country as a result of   Venezuela's recent selective default determination, of   increasingly restrictive exchange controls, sanctions on   government officials, and other operating restrictions that have   hindered materially our ability to make key financial decisions   for that market."" The loss of its Venezuelan market obviously stung, but was   hardly life-threatening.
Arnt admitted this move was   ""self-inflicted"" in the company's 2018 Q3   conference call    , but said it ""comes with the intended benefit of growing average   ticket levels, that drive the improved economics for our free   shipping program that we were able to deliver during the   quarter."" Finally, MercadoLibre is seeing an   increased interest    in Brazil from   Amazon.com, Inc    (NASDAQ: AMZN) , whose presence is often reason enough to send   skittish investors toward the exits.
Yet with Amazon having sold   books in Brazil for nearly six years, and electronics and other   assorted products since late 2017, MercadoLibre is still showing   strong growth    in the region.
Reasons for optimism Despite these concerns, none of which should be taken lightly,   MercadoLibre is a company investing heavily in growth, an action   that often leads to volatility and an immediate hit in earnings.
This growth could be the result of the platform's growing   capability to deliver items within 48 hours of being ordered, a   much more difficult feat in some South American regions than in   the U.S. In Q3, the items shipped within this time frame rose 15%   over 2017's third quarter, with particular success being seen in   Mexico, where 80% of all merchandise is being delivered within   the time frame.
Within the next decade, it is entirely possible MercadoLibre's   digital wallet business will dwarf its marketplace, or the   company will be better known as a shipping and logistics company   than a selling platform.

425,"January 23, 2019, 08:05:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Mondelez (MDLZ) Q4 Earnings to Gain From Savings Efforts,"
  Mondelez International, Inc. MDLZ  is set to report fourth-quarter and 2018 results on Jan 30, after market close. We note that the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 2.2%. In fact, the bottom line has been impressive for almost a year. Let's delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarterly release and see if this food and beverage company can maintain positive earnings surprise streak.  makeArticleAd(); Buyouts & Other Efforts to Build Brands    Mondelez is always keen on expanding its business through acquisitions. In July 2018, the company completed the buyout of 13.8% ownership in the Keurig Dr Pepper business. Prior to this, in June 2018, Mondelez concluded the buyout of Tate's Bake Shop. Tate's is one of the fastest growing biscuit brands in the United States and complements Mondelez's portfolio. In fact, during the third quarter, Tate's Bake Shop contributed significantly toward the top line.  Also, in 2018, the company teamed up with Post Consumer Brands, a business unit of Post Holdings POST  , to create two new cookie-inspired breakfast cereals. Further, acquisitions of LU biscuit business and Cadbury are highly significant for Mondelez, as these buyouts helped it expand internationally. The company plans to continue making acquisitions to gain scale in its categories and distribution capabilities.    Mondelez is also committed toward refreshing brand portfolio through product innovation and extending brands to newer geographies and platforms. Further, it is increasing investment toward in-store execution and advertising to support Power Brands. Augmenting digital presence is also a vital strategy for Mondelez to empower brands. In this respect, the company formed strategic partnerships with biggies like Facebook FB  and Amazon AMZN  in the United States. The company believes that e-commerce, its fastest growing platform, can generate $1-billion annual revenues by 2020.    We note that such efficient brand building efforts combined with effective pricing strategies are aiding volume growth across major market regions and product categories. These efforts are likely to boost the company's performance in the fourth quarter.  Mondelez International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS   Surprise         Mondelez International, Inc. Price, Consensus and   EPS Surprise    |      Mondelez International, Inc. Quote      Savings Efforts to Fuel Bottom Line    Mondelez is taking major steps to enhance productivity savings to boost margins, cash flow and returns on invested capital. Such savings initiatives were a fundamental aspect driving profits in the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, the company is gaining from higher cocoa cost. Moreover, the company continues to strike the right balance between volume and profit through disciplined pricing. Backed by such upsides, the company expects adjusted operating margin to be 17% in 2018, up almost 70 basis points from 2017's tally. Further, it anticipates double-digit growth in currency-neutral adjusted earnings per share in 2018.    Such aspects boost our expectations regarding a sturdy bottom-line performance in the impending quarter. Incidentally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings, which is currently pegged at 63 cents per share, reflects a rise of almost 10.5% from the prior-year quarter's reported figure. Further, the current estimate has been stable in the past 30 days.   Weak Business Regions & Currency Woes Linger    Operational challenges are limiting Mondelez's North America business unit. This weighed upon the region's volumes and revenues in the third quarter of 2018. Although the company is working toward uplifting the region's performance by investing in improved systems and expansion of capabilities, a turnaround is likely to take time. Moreover, the quarter continued to witness weaknesses in Brazil, thanks to price gaps. Also, management anticipates negative impacts from currency fluctuations in 2018. Such headwinds are likely to impede top-line growth in the upcoming quarterly result. In fact, the consensus mark for revenues for the fourth quarter, which is pegged at $6,772 million, depicts a decline of nearly 2.8% from the year-ago quarter's tally.    All said, let's now take a look at the Zacks Model for the upcoming quarterly release.   What the Zacks Model Unveils    Our proven model doesn't show that Mondelez is likely to beat bottom-line estimates in the upcoming quarterly results. For this to happen, a stock needs to have a positive  Earnings ESP   and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter  .

Buy-and-hold investing isn't just about sitting around and collecting dividends.That's not to cast any aspersions on dividends. Far from it. Regular and rising payouts are often the key to beating the market over long periods of time. Just have a look at the best stocks in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over the past half-century.makeArticleAd();But when we're looking at shorter time frames, such as, say, a single decade, strong and sustainable earnings growth is a critical factor too. Companies with key advantages in growing industries - or that have a long history of adapting to changing times - have a better chance of outperformance in the decade ahead.It also doesn't hurt to find yourself in rapidly evolving sectors that continually spawn new ways to drive revenue growth. Think: technology or finance or health care.That said, boring can be beautiful too.SEE ALSO: 101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and BeyondAdobe SystemsMarket value: $119.0 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' opinion: 14 strong buy, 1 buy, 8 hold, 0 sell, 0 strong sellAdobe Systems ( ADBE , $243.85) has always had little competition in its niche of creating software for designers and other creative types. Indeed, the company's Creative Suite - which includes the likes of Photoshop, Premiere Pro for video editing and Dreamweaver for website design, among others - really has no peer.The company took a massive step a few years ago when it migrated its vast portfolio of offerings to a cloud-based subscription model. Delivering software via subscription offers a steadier stream of revenue compared to one-off software sales. It also lowers costs. Analysts expect the cloud-based business to drive highly profitable growth for a long time to come.ADBE stock currently trades at 25 times forward earnings, which sounds pricey until you see that analysts forecast average profit growth of almost 23% a year for the next five years, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Analysts at Credit Suisse, who rate shares at ""Outperform"" (buy), note that the company's recent announcement of price hikes on some products ""demonstrates Adobe's ability to drive innovation and price for value, and we note price is just one of the many levers for growth.""SEE ALSO: The 25 Best Blue-Chip Stocks for 2019 (According to Hedge Funds)AlphabetMarket value: $746.6 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' opinion: 23 strong buy, 3 buy, 0 hold, 0 sell, 0 strong sellAlphabet ( GOOGL , $1,078.63), parent of search-engine leader and digital advertising giant Google, is more than a one-trick pony. But even if it had only Google to rely on ... well, what a trick that would be!Google alone gives the company commanding market share in the still-fast-growing digital ad industry. Indeed, Google is forecast to capture $102.4 billion in global digital ad spending in 2019, according to eMarketer, a market research firm. Facebook ( FB ), which is No. 2 in market share after Google, is forecast to pull in ""only"" $67.2 billion.Alphabet also is home to self-driving car startup Waymo, as well as Nest Labs, a developer of gadgets for the Internet of Things. Farther afield, the company is plowing investments into the next big things. It has artificial intelligence, machine learning and virtual reality in its sights, and it's already a major player in the fast growing industry of cloud-based services.Analysts at Canaccord Genuity rate GOOGL at ""Buy,"" noting that the digital advertising market remains robust. Alphabet's earnings are expected to rise an an average annual clip of more than 15% for the next five years, according to Thomson Reuters data.SEE ALSO: 19 Best Retirement Stocks to Buy in 2019Amazon.comMarket value: $798.1 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' opinion: 24 strong buy, 1 buy, 2 hold, 0 sell, 0 strong sellThere are many reasons to be bullish on Amazon.com ( AMZN , $1,632.17) as a long-term holding. It's the e-commerce leader, chewing up one industry after another , from discount stores to grocers to perhaps even pharmacies one day. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-computing platform is a juggernaut at a time when the growth of cloud computing - and the coming rollout of next generation 5G wireless networks - could potentially supercharge its growth.But the core reason to like AMZN long-term is founder Jeff Bezos' commitment to maintaining long horizons. The chairman and CEO has never managed the business quarter-to-quarter, and AMZN has never been afraid to forego short-term profits to make big, expensive strategic bets. That's partly why Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.B ), has been effusive in his praise of Bezos.""We haven't seen many businessmen like him,"" Buffett says of Bezos . ""Overwhelmingly, he's taken things you and I've been buying, and he's figured out a way to make us happier buying those products, either by fast delivery or prices or whatever it may be, and that's remarkable.""When the most successful patient investor of all time sings someone's praises, it's worth listening to the tune. Analysts expect Amazon's earnings to rise at an average annual rate of 42% for the next half-decade.SEE ALSO: 20 Top Stock Picks the Analysts Love for 2019AppleMarket value: $725.1 billionDividend yield: 1.9%Analysts' opinion: 11 strong buy, 1 buy, 17 hold, 0 sell, 0 strong sellNot too long ago, Apple ( AAPL , $153.30) was making headlines for being the first U.S. company to top $1 trillion in market value. My, how times change - and fast. AAPL stock has lost about a third of its value since topping out in early October 2018, erasing about $275 billion in market value along the way. Investors are terrified that the company's iPhone growth engine is finally starting to sputter.But value investors, notably Warren Buffett, know that Apple's long-term prospects rest on more than just that single shiny gadget. That's why Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has absolutely piled into Apple's stock over the past few years. Indeed, Berkshire, with its 5.3% stake in Apple, is now the company's third-largest shareholder.It's no secret that Apple wasn't going to be able to rely on accelerating iPhone sales forever. ""Peak iPhone"" has been a bearish talking point for years. Rather, what makes Apple attractive for long-term holders is its vast installed user base of loyal super-loyal iPhone customers who use the companies other hardware, and crucially, services.This dedicated and still growing ecosystem promises to generate steady cash-flow generation far into the future. As Buffett once said to CNBC, he loves the power of Apple's brand and its ecosystem of products (such as the iPhone and iPad) and services (such as Apple Pay and iTunes). ""I do not focus on the sales in the next quarter or the next year,"" he said. ""I focus on the ... hundreds, hundreds, hundreds millions of people who practically live their lives by (the iPhone).""AAPL's stock trades at just 11.5 times expected earnings - despite a long-term earnings growth forecast of 13% a year for the next half-decade. It's a cash machine. And it pays a fast-rising dividend. That makes it a long-term bargain at current levels.SEE ALSO: The 12 Best Tech Stocks for a 2019 RecoveryBerkshire HathawayMarket value: $494.1 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' opinion: 3 strong buy, 0 buy, 1 hold, 0 sell, 0 strong sellBRK.Bthe best stock in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of the past 50 yearsthe 12th best stock of all timeFor one thing, the Buffett way of doing things is a process, and his hand-picked lieutenants Ted Weschler and Todd Combs appear to be able stewards of Berkshire's portfolio of stock picks.It's also important to remember that Berkshire isn't just an investment vehicle. It's a conglomerate with scores of wholly owned subsidiaries run by management teams Buffett trusts as being the best of the best. And whether Buffett buys a company outright or merely takes a position in its stock, his preferred holding period is ""forever.""The bottom line is that Berkshire Hathaway is more than Warren Buffett. It's a disciplined and rigorous system of deploying capital. As long as Buffett's successors adhere to his rules, Berkshire Hathaway should continue to generate long-term outperformance.SEE ALSO: 10 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying (And 6 He's Selling)BoeingMarket value: $203.2 billionDividend yield: 2.3%Analysts' opinion: 13 strong buy, 1 buy, 2 hold, 0 sell, 0 strong sellBoeing ( BA , $357.90) is the beneficiary of some powerful demographic and industry trends. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) - an industry trade group - expects the number of airline passengers worldwide to double to 8.2 million by 2037. Airlines are going to need a lot of commercial jets to meet all that added demand.But Boeing is much more than just commercial aviation. The company is a major defense contractor, manufacturing everything from rockets to satellites to military tilt-rotor aircraft like the Osprey.Commercial aviation, however, is the way Boeing is going to catch a tailwind from the explosive growth in global air travel. After all, it forms half of the duopoly for large commercial airliners. Only Europe's Airbus competes with it on the same level in making big jets.Wall Street is optimistic about Boeing's short-term prospects too. Of the 16 analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research, 13 says it's a ""Strong Buy,"" one calls it a ""Buy,"" and two have it at ""Hold."" Canaccord Genuity, which rates shares at ""Hold"" on concerns about global growth, says Boeing's recent decision to increase its dividend and share buyback program sends a ""bullish signal on its outlook.""SEE ALSO: Millionaires in America: All 50 States RankedMcDonald'sMarket value: $142.3 billionDividend yield: 2.6%Analysts' opinion: 13 strong buy, 2 buy, 6 hold, 0 sell, 0 strong sellMcDonald's ( MCD , $184.57) might be the least sexy, most old-school name on this list, but when it comes to stocks for the long term, history teaches us never to count out the Golden Arches.Changing consumers taste will always be a risk, but from the Atkins craze of the early 2000s to the current fetish for fresher ingredients, McDonald's has always managed to maintain its edge. Over the years it has added salads to its menu, rolled out all-day breakfast and now touts never-frozen beef. At the moment, McDonald's is trying to drive growth through value, via a $1-$2-$3 menu and, more recently, a 2-for-5 mix-and-match menu.That sort of flexibility, and rising dividends, have been key to its market-beating returns over the long haul. Indeed, MCD has been one of the best stocks in the S&P 500 over the past 50 years. That's partly because the world's largest hamburger chain also happens to be a dividend stalwart. McDonald's payout dates back to 1976 and has gone up every year ever since.Analysts expec t earnings to grow at an average annual rate of 9% over the next five years, according to data from Thomson Reuters.

The rest, as they say, is history. Microsoft's stock has more than doubled over the past three years. Apple, by way of comparison, is up less than 50% over the same span. Indeed, MSFT has recently vaulted past Apple and other tech giants to become the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.Past is not necessarily prologue, but Wall Street is wild about the company's prospects. Software services such as Office 365 and fast-growing Azure continue to deliver growth, notes Canaccord Genuity, which rates shares at ""Buy."" The analysts also point to Microsoft's success with its Xbox online gaming franchise. Of the 21 analysts tracked by Zacks, 19 say MSFT is a ""Strong Buy.""Analysts expect earnings to rise at an average rate of more than 14% a year for the next five years.

It also boasts a whopping five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 27%. But the big reason to like this stock for the long haul is that the company is at the forefront of a seismic industry shift.""True innovation dramatically changes patient care and outcomes, disrupts the way care is provided and the setting in which it is consumed, and ultimately bends the trajectory of medical cost growth,"" note Credit Suisse analysts, who rate UNH at ""Outperform."" ""Today, we see innovation in health care being driven by services, and we see UNH as the leading driver of that change.""UNH is leading the charge by integrating the health-care delivery system and directing services to the most appropriate settings, the analysts note, and by aligning incentives between payers and providers, among other endeavors.Perhaps most importantly, the company is managing to deliver near-term earnings growth even while it invests heavily for the future. Earnings exceeded Wall Street forecasts in the most recent quarter, led by Optum. Optum runs a large pharmacy benefit management business and an expanding roster of clinics and urgent care and surgery centers.The growing reliance on the kind of services provided by Optum - as opposed to the traditional, less profitable insurance business - makes UNH a good long-term bet.SEE ALSO: The Best Health-Care Stocks to Buy for 2019U.S. BancorpMarket value: $80.6 billionDividend yield: 3.0%Analysts' opinion: 5 strong buy, 0 buy, 9 hold, 2 sell, 1 strong sellU.S. Bancorp ( USB , $50.14) is the nation's fifth-largest bank by assets and its biggest regional bank. And as a major regional bank, it's a great way to make a bet on the long-term growth of the U.S. economy.Warren Buffett has never said much about USB, but he's never been shy about betting in the U.S. economy and he's a big believer in U.S. Bancorp. The Berkshire Hathaway CEO bought another 9.8 million shares in the bank in the third quarter.Heck, the Oracle of Omaha likes the firm  so much, Berkshire Hathaway is U.S. Bancorp's biggest shareholder at 7.7% of all shares outstanding, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.Analysts at Sandler O'Neill Research say, ""USB's fundamentals remain very strong, but the shares already trade at a deserved premium to peers.

""Visa is also excited about the prospect of Visa Direct, which allows users to both send and receive money, materially expanding the business well beyond the traditional consumer-to-business model,"" CS says.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Visa's profits to increase an average of 16% a year over the next half-decade.But it's not just analysts who like Visa stock. It's a top stock pick of hedge-fund managers too. Even better for investors looking out a decade and beyond, Visa also happens to be one of Warren Buffett's favorite stocks.

Reuters

By Jamie Freed
SINGAPORE, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Europe'sArianespace is discounting the price of satellite launches with its Ariane 5 rockets as it competes against U.S. rival SpaceX for customers before the release of the cheaper Ariane 6 rocket next year, a senior executive said on Wednesday.
Arianespace is aiming for the cost of launching the Ariane 6 to fall by around 40 percent versus the Ariane 5 through design changes and higher volume production, bringing its prices more in line with Elon Musk's SpaceX, Arianespace Managing Director and Head of Sales for Asia-Pacific Vivian Quenet said.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
""We have made a lot of effort on the sales price. When we do that, the result is very positive,"" Quenet told reporters on Wednesday, declining to discuss details of profitability.
Arianespace is competing for two major launch contracts in the Asia-Pacific region that should be awarded this year and expects there could be tenders for another three, he said.
Arianespace, majority-owned by a joint venture of Airbus  and Safran, completed 11 launches with its Ariane 5, Vega and Soyuz rockets in 2018, in line with guidance that had been lowered mid-year from an initial 14. 
The company, which has a mission of guaranteeing Europe independent access to space and is used by government and commercial clients, this month forecast up to 12 launches in 2019, with four of them targeted in the first quarter.
The Satellite Industry Association lobby group estimates the satellite launch services market is worth $5.5 billion a year.  SpaceX has upended the industry with reusable rocket technology that has slashed the cost of space transportation.
Another U.S. group, the United Launch Alliance joint venture between Boeing Co  and Lockheed Martin Corp, said  last week it would conduct the final design review for its new flagship Vulcan rocket within months as it also looks to lower costs to better compete against SpaceX. 
Amazon.com Inc  founder Jeff Bezos'Blue Origin said this month it will fly its still-in-development New Glenn rocket in 2021 - the same year as Vulcan.
SpaceX, which media reports say is valued at $30.5 billion, said this month it would fire about 10 percent of its more than 6,000 employees, seeking to create a leaner company to deal with the ""extraordinarily difficult"" challenges of developing interplanetaryspacecraft and a global space-based internet. 
Arianespace's majority shareholder, ArianeGroup, announced on Tuesday it had signed a contract with the European Space Agency to study a mission to the moon before 2025 with the aim of mining regolith, an ore from which it is possible to extract water and oxygen. 
Quenet said if the mission proceeded, it would be launched with the Ariane 6 at its facilities in French Guiana.

430,"January 22, 2019, 07:54:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Amazon Earnings Preview: 5 Things to Watch,"
  Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN)  is slated to report its fourth-quarter and   full-year 2018 results       after the market closes    on Thursday, Jan. 31. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant is going into its   report on less of a strong note than it did going into its   previous quarterly reports this year. While Amazon once again   trounced Wall Street's earnings expectations   last quarter    , it released much weaker-than-anticipated fourth-quarter revenue   guidance, and its operating income outlook came in light relative   to recent results. Amazon stock has gained 31.2% over the one-year period through   Friday, Jan. 18. This is a great showing, considering the   S&P 500     (including dividends) is down 2.7% over this period.makeArticleAd(); Here's what to watch when    Amazon   report    s.   Image source: Getty Images.  Key numbers Here are Amazon's year-ago results, its fourth-quarter revenue   guidance (the company doesn't provide an outlook for earnings,   just for revenue and operating income), and Wall Street's   estimates to use as benchmarks.      Metric     Q4 2017 Result     Amazon's Q4 2018 Guidance     Amazon's Projected Year-Over-Year             Change     Wall Street's Q4 2018 Consensus     Wall Street's Projected Year-Over-Year             Change          Revenue   $60.45 billion   $66.5 billion to $72.5 billion   10% to 19.9%   $71.82 billion   18.8%     Earnings per share (EPS)   $2.16   N/A   N/A   $5.65   162%     Data sources: Amazon and Yahoo! Finance. For the fourth quarter, Amazon guided for operating income of   $2.1 billion to $3.6 billion, representing growth of 0% to 71%   year over year. Given that operating income soared 966% (   Q3    ), 378% (   Q2    ), and 92% (   Q1    ) year over year in the three preceding quarters, you can see why   the market was disappointed when the company released its   outlook. For the fourth quarter, Wall Street is looking for earnings   growth of 162% year over year. Given the company's history of   trouncing earnings expectations, investors can probably expect   another earnings beat. However, the e-commerce giant could have a   more challenging time demolishing the earnings consensus like it   did in the first three quarters of the year. For one thing,   Amazon's year-over-year results will no longer be getting a lift   from its Whole Foods acquisition, which closed in August   2017. For some context, here are Amazon's year-over-year growth   results for the first three quarters of 2018:   Q3:      Revenue and EPS rose 29% and 1,006%, respectively.  Q2:      Revenue and EPS jumped 39% and 1,168%, respectively.  Q1:      Revenue and EPS surged 43% and 121%, respectively.  North America's operating income One of the two biggest themes this year in Amazon's results is   the North America segment's blazing operating income growth. In   the second quarter, this segment -- by far the largest by revenue   -- posted operating income growth of 321% year over year,   resulting in it contributing more to Amazon's total operating   income than did Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud   computing service. North America came darn close to repeating   this impressive feat in the third quarter, when its operating   income skyrocketed 1,714% year over year to $2 billion. That was   just slightly lower than AWS' $2.1 billion contribution to   Amazon's overall operating income of $3.7 billion. (International   had an operating loss of $385 million.) Amazon Web Services' accelerating profitability The other major theme this year has been AWS becoming an even   more powerful profit machine. In the third quarter, it had a   whopping 31.1% operating margin (operating income divided by   revenue), up from 26.9% in the second quarter, and 25.7% in the   first quarter. Given how profitable AWS is, it's a huge plus that its revenue   growth has been strong. In constant currency, the cloud service's   revenue surged 46% year over year in the third quarter, 49% in   the second quarter and 48% in the first quarter. Cash flows Growth in operating income and net income, or ""earnings,"" is   well and good, but these metrics are simply accounting measures.   Cash flows are better measures of a company's performance. Don't   be too concerned with free cash flow, because Amazon spends   heavily on growth initiatives, but do focus on cash generated   from operations, which reflects the profitability of the   company's current operations. Last quarter, operating cash flow grew 57% year over year to   $26.6 billion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash   flow nearly doubled to $15.4 billion from $8 billion. Q1 2019 guidance Given that the stock market is a forward-looking machine, the   market's reaction to Amazon's earnings release is probably going   to hinge more on the company's guidance for the first quarter of   2019 than on its results for the fourth quarter of 2018. So you should know what Wall Street is expecting. For Q1 2019,   the Street is projecting revenue to increase 19.5% year over year   to $60.99 billion and EPS to jump 36.1% to $4.45.   10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

431,"January 22, 2019, 07:26:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,What to Expect from Alibaba (BABA) Earnings Amid Chinese Economic Slowdown,"
 Alibaba BABA  stock has climbed over 15% since Christmas along with much of the market, driven by giants like Facebook FB  and Google GOOGL  . Despite its recent climb, investors have grown nervous about companies with exposure to China's slowing economy. This means Wall Street will be laser-focused on the Chinese e-commerce powerhouse when Ali baba report  s its quarterly financial results on Wednesday, January 30.  Overview  Alibaba in November cut its full-year revenue forecast, citing increased worries about the slowing Chinese economy. The e-commerce giant's fears were seemingly confirmed after reports this week said that China's economy grew by 6.6% in 2018. This marked the country's slowest pace since 1990  as the trade war with the U.S. continues. Earlier this month, Apple AAPL  sent shockwaves through Wall Street when it lowered its quarterly guidance on the back of subdued Chinese sales. Now investors are waiting on the likes of Starbucks SBUX  , Nike NKE  , and many other companies with a large amount of business in China to report their quarterly results in order to see what impact a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy might have. With that said, Alibaba runs China's two largest e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, and its sales often serve as a kind of barometer for China's consumer economy. Last quarter, BABA's commerce business accounted for 85% of its overall revenues. Alibaba has also pushed further into cloud computing in an effort to compete against Microsoft MSFT  , IBM IBM  , Google, and its U.S. counterpart Amazon AMZN  . BABA's cloud revenues soared 90% last quarter. Plus, Alibaba has expanded its digital media and entertainment business in the age of Netflix NFLX  .     Quarterly Outlook  Alibaba is coming off a September quarter that saw its overall revenues surge 54% to hit $12.398 billion, which marked a sequential downturn from the June quarter's 61% top-line expansion. Looking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Alibaba's quarterly revenues to jump 35.2% from the year-ago period's $12.76 billion to reach $17.26 billion. Clearly, this would mark a significant downturn compared to the trailing two quarters. Plus, Alibaba's revenues soared 56% in the December period of last year. Alibaba's full-year revenues are projected to jump 43.6% to reach $55.04 billion. This would also mark a slowdown from fiscal 2018's 58% year-over-year expansion. Therefore, it seems that the Chinese economic slowdown is in full effect as consumers spend less money on the country's most popular online marketplace. Moving onto the bottom end of the income statement, BABA's adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to pop 0.61% to reach $1.64 per share. Meanwhile, the firm's full fiscal year earnings are expected to dip 1.15%. The company is still firmly in its growth phase, which means earnings don't matter as much for many investors.     Bottom Line  Alibaba stock slipped 3.10% during regular trading hours Thursday to hit $152.15 a share, which marked a roughly 28% downturn from its 52-week high of $211.70. Alibaba is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) at the moment based, in large part, on the negative earnings estimate revision activity for the firm's upcoming fiscal year. With that said, BABA has seen some positivity within the last 30 days as well. In the end, investors likely won't be pleased to see a major top-line slowdown is expected from Alibaba amid a slowing Chinese economy. The e-commerce firm's quarterly estimates also help solidify a potentially worrying sign for our interconnected  global market  s. Alibaba is scheduled to release its December quarter financial results on Wednesday, January 30.

432,"January 22, 2019, 05:32:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,"Intel (INTC) Q4 Earnings Preview: Client Computing, Data Centers, IoT & More","
 Shares of Intel INTC  have surged 11% since Christmas along with giants like Amazon AMZN  , Facebook FB  , and much of the market. Despite this climb, INTC stock rests roughly 17% below its 52-week high and fell over 1.9% Tuesday on the back of global growth concerns. Now, let's see what investors should expect from Intel's fourth-quarter financial results, including data centers and Internet of Things, ahead of the firm's Q4 earnings release Thursday.  Quick Economic Overview  Intel is the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, which means Wall Street will likely use its quarterly results to help gauge the global economy. As the trade war between the world's two largest economies marches on, many fear that a slowdown in China will lead to slower global growth. Apple's AAPL  lowered quarterly guidance helped kick these fears into overdrive to start the year. Reports in the coming weeks from the likes of IBM IBM  , Microsoft MSFT  , Texas Instruments TXN  , Nvidia NVDA  , and many more giants might help clarify the global economic conditions.       Outlook  Moving onto Intel specifically, investors should look for any updates on its next-generation chips, which have been delayed to the delight of rivals like Advanced Micro Devices AMD  . Last we heard, interim CEO Robert Swan said Intel is on track launch its 10-nanometer-based systems by the 2019 holiday season. At the moment, our Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Intel's Q4 revenues to jump 11.5% to reach $19.01 billion. Investors should note that this would mark a slowdown from Q3's 19% growth, but would top the prior-year quarter's 4% top-line expansion. Meanwhile, Intel's adjusted Q4 earnings are projected to surge nearly 13% to reach $1.22 per share. This bottom-line estimate would also represent a significant slowdown from Q3's 39% top-line growth and Q4 2017's 37% climb. With that said, investors need to know what to expect from Intel's three largest business units as they could determine how INTC stock trades following its earnings release, especially in the near-term. Luckily, we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file to help. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.     Client Computing  Intel's largest business unit remains Client Computing, which primarily consists of the company's PC processor and related component sales. This division is projected to jump roughly 9.9% from $8.954 billion in the year-ago quarter to reach $9.841 billion in Q4. Investors should note that Client Computing revenues surged 15.5% in the third quarter.

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc'sGoogle disclosed in a quarterly filing on Tuesday that it spent a company-record $21.2 million on lobbying the U.S. government in 2018, topping its previous high of $18.22 million in 2012, as the search engine operator fights wide-ranging scrutiny into its practices.
In its filing to Congress on Tuesday, Facebook Inc  disclosed that it also spent more on government lobbying in 2018 than it ever had before at $12.62 million. That was up from $11.51 million a year ago, according to tracking by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Google and Facebook declined to comment beyond their filings.
U.S. lawmakers and regulators have weighed new privacy and antitrust rules to rein in the power of large internet service providers such as Google, Facebook and Amazon.com Inc. Regulatory backlash in the United States, as well as Europe and Asia, is near the top of the list of concerns for technology investors, according to financial analysts.
Microsoft Corp  spent $9.52 million on lobbying in 2018, according to its disclosure on Tuesday, up from $8.5 million in 2017 but below its $10.5 million tab in 2013.
Apple Inc  spent $6.62 million last year, compared to its record of $7.15 million in 2017, according to center data going back to 1998. 
Apple and Microsoft did not respond to requests to comment. A filing from Amazon was expected later on Tuesday.
Google disclosed that new discussion topics with regulators in the fourth quarter included its search technology, criminal justice reform and international tax reform. The company is perennially among the top spenders on lobbying in Washington along with a few cable operators, defense contractors and healthcare firms.
Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, who testified in December before a U.S. House of Representatives panel for the first time, has said the company backs the idea of national privacy legislation. But he has contested accusations of the company having a political bias in its search results and of  stifling competition.
Susan Molinari, Google's top U.S. public policy official, stepped down to take on an advisory role this month. 
Facebook said discussing ""election integrity"" with national security officials was among its new lobbying areas in the fourth quarter. The filing said the company continued to lobby the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating its data security practices.

Jan 22 (Reuters) - Viacom Inc  said on Tuesday it will buy Pluto TV, a free video streaming TV service, for $340 million in cash to expand its advanced advertising business.
The owner of MTV Networks and Nickelodeon sees the purchase of the six-year-old company as another way to build a so-called direct-to-consumer business, Viacom said, while avoiding the capital intensive task of competing directly against subscription video services owned or to be built by Netflix Inc, Walt Disney Co  and AT&T Inc's  WarnerMedia.
Viacom's moves reflect a rekindled interest in advertising supported digital media kicked off by Roku, a device maker that helped viewers stream online videos on TVs that was spun off from Netflix. Amazon has also launched a free TV service recently.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
It is available on devices made by Roku Inc , Amazon.com Inc, Sony Corp and Apple Inc. The app is also available on smart televisions from Samsung and Vizio.
Viacom said it sees Pluto TV as an important outlet for it to sell advanced advertising that has the ability to target viewers based on their habits.
While Viacom has no plans to make current shows on pay TV services available for free on the service, it sees Pluto TV as a way to make money off its archives.

Jan 22 (Reuters) - IBM Corp  beat Wall Street quarterly earnings estimates and also forecast 2019 profit above expectations on Tuesday, in the latest indication that Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty's efforts to turn around the technology services company were gaining traction.
Shares rose 7 percent in extended trading after IBM also posted its first annual revenue growth since 2011.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh told Reuters that IBM signed roughly $16 billion worth of contracts in the quarter, its strongest by that measure in a long time.
Underscoring the drive into higher-margin businesses, IBM in October agreed to buy software company Red Hat Inc  for $34 billion, the company's biggest acquisition in its more than 100-year history. 
In a nod to investor concerns, Kavanaugh on a post-earnings call with analysts said client response to the Red Hat acquisition has been ""overwhelmingly positive.""
IBM's cloud strategy has focused on helping companies stitch together multiple cloud platforms rather than compete head on with ""hyperscale"" cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure  and Alphabet Inc'sGoogle.
IBM's cloud business overall grew 12 percent to $19.2 billion in 2018. It is one area IBM has actively looked to build and part of its ""Strategic Imperatives,"" which also include analytics, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
The core cloud businesses performed ""quite well"" in the quarter and is consistent with an overall view that enterprises are increasingly moving into the full-scale cloud migration, MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis said.
IBM said its gross profit margin, another closely monitored metric, expanded to 49.1 percent compared with 49 percent a year ago and it expects to build on that momentum in 2019.
The company forecast adjusted operating earnings for 2019 to be ""at least"" $13.90 per share, while analysts on average were expecting $13.79, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
IBM projected 2019 free cash flow of about $12 billion, the same range it set for 2018, while Wall Street on average expects $12.67 billion.
IBM said revenue slipped to $21.76 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, but came in above analysts' average estimate of $21.71 billion.
The strengthening of the dollar cost over $2 billion of revenue in 2018, Kavanaugh said. Armonk, New York-based IBM gets over 60 percent of its revenue from outside the United States.
The company's cognitive software business, which houses artificial intelligence platform Watson, analytics and cybersecurity services, reported sales of $5.46 billion, compared with analysts' expectation of $5.25 billion.
IBM's revenue of $4.32 billion from its global businesses services segment also beat estimates of $4.15 billion.
Excluding special items, the company earned $4.87 per share, above expectations of $4.82.

By Stephen Culp
NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on Tuesday, snapping a four-session rally, as a gloomy global economic growth outlook, trade concerns and disappointing company forecasts dampened sentiment.
All three major U.S. stock indexes pared losses after White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow denied a report by the Financial Times that the Trump administration canceled preparatory trade talks with China. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
On Monday, the International Monetary Fund trimmed its 2019 global economic growth estimates,  and China confirmed its slowest economic growth rate in 28 years. 
""There seems to be a plethora of negative news regarding the global economy and China and the corporate profits that were reported today couldn't offset that,"" said Chuck Carlson,  chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.
""A lot of companies are coming out with earnings this week, so it's going to be a battle between earnings and the perception of what's going on China and the global market,"" Carlson added.
The downbeat China news pulled chipmakers lower. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index  fell 2.9 percent.
Each of the FAANG momentum stocks, Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com, Netflix Inc  and Google parent Alphabet Inc, ended down between 1.6 percent and 4.1 percent.
Fears of a slowdown in corporate profits mounted as companies posting fourth-quarter results provided disappointing forward-looking projections.
Johnson & Johnson  dropped 1.4 percent after its 2019 sales forecast fell short of analyst expectations. 
Shares of Stanley Black & Decker Inc  tumbled 15.5 percent after its disappointing 2019 forecast. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 301.87 points, or 1.22 percent, to 24,404.48. The S&P 500  lost 37.81 points, or 1.42 percent, to 2,632.9 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 136.87 points, or 1.91 percent, to 7,020.36.
Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, all but utilities  closed lower. Industrials, energy, communications services  and consumer discretionary  had the largest percentage losses.
With just over 12 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported thus far, 78.7 percent have beat expectations. Analysts expect S&P 500 fourth-quarter earnings growth of 14.1 percent, down from 20.1 percent on Oct. 1, according to Refinitiv data.
Oilfield services company Halliburton Co  declined 3.1 percent as falling oil prices  and slowing U.S. demand weighed on fourth-quarter results. 
International Business Machines Corp  rose in post-market trading after reporting a smaller-than-expected drop in fourth-quarter revenue. 
During the dearth of U.S. economic data stemming from the government shutdown, a report from the National Association of Realtors showed U.S. sales of existing homes fell in December to the lowest level in three years. 
The PHLX Housing index  fell 1.8 percent.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 19 new highs and 33 new lows.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.97 billion shares, compared to the 8.24 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

451,"January 22, 2019, 09:02:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Amazon's (AMZN) Direct Sales Move to Boost Presence in Brazil,"
  Amazon AMZN  is finally moving ahead with its plans for Brazil after a lot of delay.  makeArticleAd();  Reportedly, the company is initiating direct sales of merchandise by establishing in-house fulfilment and delivery network in Brazil.    With this initiative, Amazon's long-awaited quest to expand footprint in Brazilian e-commerce space gets a kick-start. Notably, the plans of Amazon in Brazil have been plagued with a plethora of issues like complex tax, logistics system and weak vendor relationships.    Per the latest move, the company will offer various products whose count currently stands at 320,000 which include 200,000 books, via its direct sales platform. Moreover, the merchandise will be offered under 11 categories from more than 800 sellers.    Notably, this wide array of product offerings will strengthen Amazon's e-commerce sales in Brazil. Additionally, the initiative bodes well for the company's strong focus toward bolstering presence in Latin America.   Initiative to Aid Growth    The latest initiative of Amazon is likely to benefit it in a country like Brazil where the Internet usage is rapidly increasing.    Given this, a lates t report  from Statista suggests that revenues in the e-commerce market of Brazil is expected to reach $15.9 billion in 2019. Further, revenues are anticipated to hit $17.3 billion by 2023.    Additionally, user penetration in this particular market for 2019 is pegged at 57.3% which is projected to reach 61.4% by 2023.    We believe Amazon is well poised to rapidly penetrate this potential market on the back of its vast product availability on its direct sales platform. Further, its advanced fulfillment and delivery network will help in enhancing the shopping experience of the customers, which in turn will aid growth to its customer base.   Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM)        Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM)    |      Amazon.com, Inc. Quote    Strengthening Competition  We believe Amazon's latest move is likely to strengthen its competitive position against the likes of MercadoLibre MELI  , Alibaba BABA  and Walmart WMT  which are also putting their best foot forward to bolster presence in the e-commerce space of Brazil.    Nevertheless, Amazon's growing initiatives in Brazil are likely to intensify the competition for the above-mentioned companies. Apart from its latest move, the company has already leased a 47,000 square-meter warehouse outside of Sao Paulo in order to strengthen its fulfillment program.    Further, the company has already started selling fashion and athletic apparel in Brazil via its Brazilian marketplace since mid-2018. Further, the company is gearing up to enhance product offerings by bringing a wide variety of fashion apparels and active sportswear ranging from designer Reinaldo Lourenco's collection to Alpargatas' Havaianas flip flops to Levi's Jeans.    We note that Amazon's rising investments, strengthening partnerships with fulfilment operators and last-mile carriers are likely to aid market share growth.    Currently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here.    Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

453,"January 22, 2019, 06:24:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Apple, Amazon, Verizon, Facebook, Alphabet and Qualcomm","
  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - January 22, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple (AAPL), Amazon AMZN  , Verizon VZ  , Facebook FB  and Alphabet GOOGL  and Qualcomm QCOM  .  Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:  Apple Roundup: Watch, Verizon Deal & More Here are the top Apple stories from last week:  Apple Watch for Seniors  As part of its big push into preventive healthcare, Apple is in talks with at least three private Medicare plans to cover/subsidize its Watch for senior citizens above 65 years of age. CNBC reports that there are around 19 million prospects (under the Medicare Advantage plan) that could be encouraged to wear such a device to track their health condition and take appropriate action to prevent a stroke or heart attack among other things. At the very least, such action may be able to reduce the number of visits to the emergency room. Like Amazon, which is also trying to reduce the overall cost of healthcare, Apple's measures are designed to rope in insurance companies because they are the ones that stand to gain financially from fewer hospital visits. Other than people of course, but they may not want to go in for another $400 gadget, never mind that it can do fall detection, ECG, atrial fibrillation and such. With Medicare, the government pays around $10,000 per member for providing services to seniors and wouldn't it be neat if this money could pay or subsidize the Watch. So now, Apple needs to demonstrate that the devices actually do what they promise. Which is why it's doing a heart study with Stanford University and why it's partnered with Zimmer Biomet to prove speedier recovery from knee and hip replacement procedures using the Watch. And then, there's Johnson & Johnson, with which it's doing a study to see how a J&J app works with Apple's Watch to detect and diagnose irregular heart rhythms, or atrial fibrillation, so customers can visit a doctor, get into a suitable healthcare plan or change their lifestyle as appropriate. ""We're just at the front end of this,"" Cook said in a CNBC interview. ""But I do think, looking back, in the future, you will answer that question: Apple's most important contribution to mankind has been in health.""  Verizon Pulls Closer to Apple  Apple Music subscribers are swelling and Verizon's inclusion of the service in its premium bundles (Beyond Unlimited at $85 a month and Above Unlimited at $95 a month) will bring further growth. Verizon is offering the Apple service free, which makes it all the more attractive. Including Apple not only brings its 50 million songs to Verizon premium subscribers for streaming across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, HomePod, CarPlay, PCs and Android devices, but also sets the stage for later collaboration on video as Apple continues to splurge on original content. Its peers T-Mobile offers Netflix, Sprint offers Hulu while AT&T offers its own HBO Now service as well as other options. Adding Verizon customers immediately boosts Apple subscribers with much-needed service revenue to follow. What's more, this creates the basic framework for distribution of video content when Apple's original productions are ready. Verizon being late to pick up a partner here has actually worked well for Apple.  Tim Cook on Privacy  Apple, the A in the FAANG story never misses an opportunity to take pot shots at Facebook and Alphabet, the F and the G. Apple doesn't depend on ad sales, so minimizes the amount of information it carries on its users, especially in unencrypted form. So it's hard for these companies to shout back at Apple. Here are snippets from Apple CEO Tim Cook's op-ed for Time magazine, written for ""comprehensive federal privacy legislation"" - ""One of the biggest challenges in protecting privacy is that many of the violations are invisible."" ""Consumers shouldn't have to tolerate another year of companies irresponsibly amassing huge user profiles, data breaches that seem out of control and the vanishing ability to control our own digital lives."" ""Technology has the potential to keep changing the world for the better, but it will never achieve that potential without the full faith and confidence of the people who use it."" ""All of these secondary markets for your information exist in a shadow economy that's largely unchecked -- out of sight of consumers, regulators and lawmakers,"" Cook wrote. ""Let's be clear: you never signed up for that."" ""The Federal Trade Commission should establish a data-broker clearinghouse, requiring all data brokers to register, enabling consumers to track the transactions that have bundled and sold their data from place to place, and giving users the power to delete their data on demand, freely, easily and online, once and for all.""  Germany Sides with Apple vs. Qualcomm  The regional court in the city of Mannheim dismissed the first of six patent infringement lawsuits brought by Qualcomm against Apple in Mannheim. After adverse rulings in Munich and Fuzhou (China), Apple temporarily removed the older model iPhones in dispute while keeping its latest models on sale in the country. The second ruling is slated for next month. As may be expected, Qualcomm said it would appeal while Apple said it was happy with the decision. A separate court decision in Munich earlier banned the German sale of Apple's iPhone 7 and 8.  Apple report  edly also received a negative ruling in China for its iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X. However, last November, Qualcomm was also handed a defeat by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which also ordered it to make its essential technology for modem chips available to rivals, as requested by the U.S. ITC. There's a maze of litigation going on out there. As far as investors are concerned, there's unlikely to be any major impact on Apple in the foreseeable future. And since neither party is expected to back down right now, it's a good thing that the financial impact that won't be material for Apple.

  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - January 22, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft MSFT  , Apple AAPL  , Amazon AMZN  and Alphabet GOOGL  .  Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:    Microsoft Earnings Outlook: Cloud, PCs & More    Microsoft stock  has surged over 14% since Christmas as part of the larger market resurgence. In order for the tech powerhouse to continue its run, it will likely have to impress investors with solid fiscal second quarter 2019 financial results. So, let's see what we should expect from Microsoft's top and bottom line, as well as some of its specific business units, including Intelligent Cloud, before the company reports its earnings results on Wednesday, January 30.  Quick Overview  Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet continue to fight for the title of the world's most valuable company. Still, no matter how fun this back and forth race for market cap supremacy might be, investors really care that MSFT has been able to grow its core businesses, while also expanding its reach in the new digital age. For starters, Microsoft grabbed roughly 15%  of the cloud market last quarter to come in second to Amazon. We should also note that the company's gaming business has expanded recently. Plus, CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft made 15 acquisitions  last year, highlighted by its $7.5 billion purchase of open-sourced software platform Github, which should help the company continue to expand into new growth areas.  Outlook  Microsoft's second-quarter revenues are projected to climb 12.2% to hit $32.45 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Last quarter, MSFT's revenues surged by 19% to reach $29.1 billion. Meanwhile, the tech company's adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to surge 13.5% to reach $1.09 per share. Now we need to understand what to expect from Microsoft's individual business units as they could determine how MSFT stock trades, especially in the near-term. To understand what to expect from these vital units we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.  Productivity & Business Processes  Microsoft's Productivity & Business Processes unit features the firm's Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics CRM businesses. The company is projected to see its revenues jump 12.8% from $8.953 billion to reach $10.096 billion, based on our current NFM consensus estimates. Last quarter, Productivity & Business Processes revenues surged 19%, while unit revenues climbed 25% in the year-ago period. So clearly the firm's fiscal second-quarter revenues would mark a slowdown compared to recent periods.  Intelligent Cloud  Moving on, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud is projected to surge over 19% from $7.795 billion to hit $9.295 billion. We should note that Intelligent Cloud has become one of MSFT's most important units and is comprised of the company's server and enterprise products. This segment also includes its much talked about Azure unit. With that said, Intelligent Cloud climbed 24% last quarter and popped 15% in the year-ago period.  More Personal Computing  We close with a look at what is still Microsoft's largest business segment, More Personal Computing. The division that features Microsoft Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search is projected to see its revenues reach $13.086 billion. This would mark a roughly 7.5% climb from the prior-year quarter's $12.170 billion, which itself was up only 2%. Clearly, our estimate represents solid growth compared to Q2 2018, but it would mark a sequential slowdown compared to Q1's 15% expansion. This growth was driven by its Xbox-fueled gaming segment, which soared 44% as its Xbox Game Pass grew in popularity. Microsoft is currently scheduled to report its Q2 fiscal 2019 earnings results after the closing bell on Wednesday, January 30. Make sure to check back here for our full analysis of Microsoft's actual financial results after the company reports.  Zacks' Top 10 Stocks for 2019  In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year? Who wouldn't? Our annual Top 10s have beaten the market with amazing regularity. In 2018, while the market dropped -5.2%, the portfolio scored well into double-digits overall with individual stocks rising as high as +61.5%.

  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - January 22, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: salesforce.com, inc. CRM  , Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN  , Intel Corporation INTC  , NVIDIA Corporation NVDA  and Microsoft Corporation MSFT  .  Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:    5 Fast-Growing A.I. Stocks to Buy for 2019   Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to be red hot, with its influence growing on various industries throughout the world. AI helps improve almost everything, including advertising, healthcare, robotics, retail, video streaming, gaming and urban development, to name a few.  AI expert Andrew Ng, in fact, had compared AI to the next electricity saying that ""just as electricity transformed almost everything 100 years ago, today I actually have a hard time thinking of an industry that I don't think AI will transform in the next several years."" It is now widely used in autonomous cars or smart electronic gadgets, which should help AI stocks see more ups than downs in the near future. Lest we forget, AI spending will see an average compounded annual rate of 18% to $383.5 billion by 2020, per Gartner estimates. Several Wall Street analysts expect AI-related revenues to climb from an estimated $7.35 billion last year to nearly $90 billion in 2025, primarily on the evolution of self-driven cars and smart devices. With AI here to stay, let us look at the top five AI stocks that investors could benefit from.      salesforce.com    Makes Big Leap  Cloud computing behemoth,  salesforce.com  , inc.  offers relationship management services to more than 100,000 customers.

Intel has made solid advances in AI-centric markets. Since the acquisition of the Mobileye, it is much into the self-driving space. The company is also providing chips to Alphabet's self-driving subsidiary, Waymo. Looking ahead, Intel is planning to launch a commercial self-driving taxi service along with Volkswagen in Israel.

NVIDIA is actively involved in the autonomous vehicles industry, which is expected to hit a worth of $60 billion by 2035.

458,"January 22, 2019, 05:00:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Barron's,Beware the Market's Best Performing Stocks,"
  Photograph by Jussara   Romao   After a brief hiccup in December, momentum stocks-the market's best performers-are once again back to their winning ways. The valuation gap between the market's winners and losers hit new extremes after last year's selloff, and momentum stocks now trade at much higher valuations compared with their underperforming peers. That, according to one strategist, should cause some caution for investors who bet on momentum.  The back story:  Momentum stocks were hammered during the market turmoil late last year. The Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF  (SPMO), which contains stocks like Microsoft  (MSFT) and Amazon.com  (AMZN), plunged 24% from its October peak to the trough on December 24, meeting the definition of a bear market. The S&P 500  dropped 19% during the same period. The sector composition the momentum basket has changed a lot since last year's volatility: Once dominated by tech stocks, the group now includes more health care and utilities.  The plot twist:  While momentum stocks got hit hard during the selloff, the underperformers were crushed even more. Now, the valuation gap between the winners and losers has grown even more extreme. By the end of 2018, high-momentum stocks in the U.S. are trading valuations 3.7 times greater than their low-momentum peers based on price-to-book ratios, and 2.3 times based on price-to-earnings, according to Sarah McCarthy from Bernstein. The more diverse sector exposure hasn't helped either. Valuation spreads within sectors have also increased to a very high level. The spreads haven't been this wide since 2000, noted McCarthy, and are higher than in 2009, when momentum stocks dramatically collapsed and lost 53% of their value within six months.makeArticleAd();  Moving forward:  When valuation spreads between the winners and losers get to extremes, it means there is a growing chance of reverting to the mean. This is especially dangerous as the correlation-or the tendency to move in the same direction-between momentum stocks has also moved up higher, and the factor has become crowded. The crowding levels of Tech are high but in line with historical average, while Utilities and Health Care are more crowded than they usually are, according to McCarthy. ""There is a high level of fragility in the factor,"" she wrote, ""We strongly caution against exposure to the factor and retain our short position."" As of this Thursday, the Invesco momentum fund has bounced back 15.4% since late December, but remains off 10.8% from its peak.  Write to  Evie Liu at  evie.liu@barrons.com

By Munsif Vengattil
Jan 22 (Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp sparked a 12 percent surge in shares of eBay Inc  on Tuesday by urging it to sell or separate off two of its businesses, arguing the e-commerce pioneer could double its market value within two years.
EBay shares, which lost a quarter of their value in 2018, rose 12.2 percent to $34.78 before the bell and were on course for their best performance in a year in response to the letter from one of the U.S. financial world's best-known activist investors. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
EBay did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The fund said the company should separate its ticket-sales franchise StubHub and eBay Classifieds Group from its core marketplace.
It said StubHub on its own could be worth $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion and eBay Classifieds, which could be sold or spun off, between $8 billion and $12 billion.
The shareholder also detailed a plan for operational improvement, which it said calls for a roughly $250 million increase in operating expenses from 2018 to 2021.
""While we believe that execution missteps and unclear focus have impaired value, eBay is far from broken, and its future should be bright,"" Elliott's Jesse Cohn wrote, adding that his mother had built a successful business on eBay by selling jewelry for over a decade.
The San Jose, California-based company has been splurging on product development, brand marketing and website design, while also cutting jobs, as it battles competition from Amazon.com Inc  and other online marketplaces.
Elliott said its plan earmarked 20 percent of free cash flow on an ongoing basis, or $600 million to $700 million, for annual investment in acquisitions of companies or technologies.
It called for an initial meeting with the board to discuss its concerns and for the establishment of a Strategy and Operations Committee to execute the improvement plan.

By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The future of Sears Holdings Corp  and tens of thousands of its employees across the United States hung in the balance in the freezing predawn hours last Wednesday, as Wall Street lawyers and bankers sparred over the fate of the beleaguered retailer in a 50-story Manhattan office tower.
Working the phone from Miami, where he has an office and a 17,000-square-foot mansion, was Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert. The investor had to decide between boosting the $5 billion offer he had made a week earlier for most of the retailer's remaining assets, or letting the 126-year-old company close its doors forever.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Representatives for both Sears and Lampert occupied the 24th floor offices of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, the law firm retained by the company, in the General Motors Building near Central Park. They guzzled coffee like it was water to stay awake, some eating discarded food that was not necessarily theirs. After three days of round-the-clock negotiations, the conference rooms had begun to smell, one adviser said.
Time was running out. The auction Sears was holding as part of its bankruptcy proceedings had already blown past a midnight deadline set by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain. Besides Lampert, the only other bidders were either looking at small pieces of the company or vying to shut it down altogether and sell off its assets.
Finally, at 2:30 a.m., in a conference room that had previously hosted discussions about the bankruptcies of Lehman Brothers and General Motors, a deal was clinched. Lampert would pay more than $5.2 billion to rescue Sears, acquiring the company's businesses and 425 stores and preserving about 45,000 jobs.
It was the culmination of a battle - with Sears directors and advisers on one side and Lampert and his negotiators on the other - that had begun on the last Friday in December, when the billionaire, through his hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, made an offer to take over the company. This account of those crucial three weeks, based on court documents, securities filings and interviews with nearly a dozen people familiar with the negotiations, shows how close Sears came to liquidation.
A Sears spokesman declined to comment, and a Lampert representative said he was unavailable for an interview.


PLUNGING REVENUES
When Lampert combined Sears and rival chain Kmart almost 15 years ago, he heralded the formation of a retailer with more than $55 billion in annual sales, nearly 3,500 stores and more than 300,000 employees. But within a dozen years, annual revenues had plunged to $16.7 billion in the face of competition from the likes of Amazon.com Inc  and Walmart Inc.
Lampert loaned Sears money over the years to keep it running, becoming the retailer's largest creditor in addition to its biggest shareholder. Under his leadership, Sears also spun off clothing manufacturer Lands' End, parted with 235 of its best stores for $2.7 billion to a company Lampert created called Seritage Growth Properties  and sold its Craftsman tools brand for $900 million.
None of it worked. Sears has not turned a profit since 2010.
In September, Lampert proposed a rescue plan, but a special committee of independent Sears directors spurned it. On Oct. 15, the storied retailer, which thrived with famous mail-order catalogs and once owned the tallest building in the world, filed for bankruptcy protection in White Plains, New York, federal court.
Sears listed about $7 billion in assets, which included just under 700 stores. Liabilities were more than $11 billion, including $2.6 billion owed to Lampert. The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based company by then employed about 68,000 people.
Sears formed a restructuring committee of independent directors and appointed veteran turnaround specialist Mohsin Meghji as chief restructuring officer. They soon faced a difficult choice. On Dec. 28, Lampert came forward with a takeover offer: he would pay $4.4 billion to acquire various Sears businesses and 425 stores.
The offer would preserve up to 50,000 jobs. The company's creditors, such as mall owners and vendors, pushed for liquidation, which would yield a pile of cash to pay the retailer's bills, not to mention its debts to bankruptcy lenders.


ON THE BRINK
The company faced a court-imposed Jan. 4 deadline to determine whether Lampert's bid was good enough to compete in the looming auction. The deadline came and went. Sears directors and Lampert were at loggerheads. The retailer wanted another $80 million to cover bankruptcy expenses. Lampert refused.
On Monday, Jan. 7, the deadlock appeared hopeless, said people involved in the discussions. Drain urged the two sides to keep negotiating, but talks into the night went nowhere.
Liquidation announcements were prepared by Sears and Lampert advisers, the people said. Sears tapped New Jersey-based Abacus Advisors Group LLC, whose chairman Alan Cohen was a longtime consultant to the company, to sell the chain's vast inventories of tools, appliances and store fixtures.
On Tuesday, Jan. 8, Drain delayed the start of a scheduled court hearing, allowing talks to continue. When it finally began, Ray Schrock, the Weil lawyer representing Sears, had an announcement: ""We have what we believe is some very good news for Sears and its stakeholders,"" he said.
Lampert had increased his bid to roughly $5 billion. He agreed to take on more than $600 million in additional Sears liabilities, mainly bills for merchandise and taxes, and employee severance benefits.


'FILL OR KILL'
The following Monday morning, Jan. 14, advisers for Sears and Lampert entered the General Motors Building and rode elevators to Weil's offices for the start of the auction with the recently enhanced bid in hand.
But that evening, Sears advisers at Weil's offices made an aggressive move: a demand known in Wall Street deal negotiating parlance as ""fill or kill."" The retailer wanted another $225 million to cover its bankruptcy costs, and Lampert needed to agree or abandon his takeover plan, people involved in the discussions said.
""The goalposts have moved,"" a lawyer for Lampert complained.
Nevertheless, the next morning, Lampert upped his bid. ""This is not an ordinary moment,"" said Sean O'Neal, a Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP lawyer representing Lampert. ""The fate of an American icon and 50,000 employees hangs in the balance.""
The company rejected it, deciding the offer, though better, did not prove a better alternative to a liquidation, the people said. For the second time in a week, Sears prepared to go out of business.
That afternoon, Drain called. Cut a new deal, the judge told the advisers. Sears' expenses did not necessarily have to be fully covered, he said. Drain set a midnight deadline. ""You have no more time,"" he said, citing rising Sears expenses.
""There was a dying patient on the table,"" said one adviser involved in the discussions. ""Dr. Drain helped give it life.""


A MISSED DEADLINE
The midnight deadline passed. Then Lampert placed a call to his team, people familiar with the development said. His advisers, including Kunal Kamlani, president at Lampert's hedge fund, and Lawrence Chu, a Moelis & Co banker, soon had their breakthrough.
Lampert would sweeten his bid by roughly $200 million. He agreed to take on one of the company's bankruptcy loans, which debtors typically repay, in its entirety. He also kicked in extra cash. The $5.2 billion offer would free up yet more of Sears' coffers for other expenses, including fees for advisers.
The new offer also resolved other contentious points. Lampert would be allowed to use $1.3 billionSears owed him as currency in the offer, a maneuver known as a credit bid, which some creditors had opposed.
At 12:45 a.m., Schrock, the Weil lawyer for Sears, said the company's board would consider the latest offer. At 2:30 a.m., he announced that Sears had accepted the bid.
Even then, some Sears directors had second thoughts, and discussions dragged another full day and night. Shortly after 3 a.m., on Thursday, Jan. 17, Sears approved Lampert's takeover. The auction was over.

Lampert would pay more than $5.2 billion to rescue Sears, acquiring the company's businesses and 425 stores and preserving about 45,000 jobs.It was the culmination of a battle - with Sears directors and advisers on one side and Lampert and his negotiators on the other - that had begun on the last Friday in December, when the billionaire, through his hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, made an offer to take over the company.
This account of those crucial three weeks, based on court documents, securities filings and interviews with nearly a dozen people familiar with the negotiations, shows how close Sears came to liquidation.A Sears spokesman declined to comment, and a Lampert representative said he was unavailable for an interview.PLUNGING REVENUESWhen Lampert combined Sears and rival chain Kmart almost 15 years ago, he heralded the formation of a retailer with more than $55 billion in annual sales, nearly 3,500 stores and more than 300,000 employees.
The company's creditors, such as mall owners and vendors, pushed for liquidation, which would yield a pile of cash to pay the retailer's bills, not to mention its debts to bankruptcy lenders.ON THE BRINKThe company faced a court-imposed Jan. 4 deadline to determine whether Lampert's bid was good enough to compete in the looming auction.
Drain urged the two sides to keep negotiating, but talks into the night went nowhere.Liquidation announcements were prepared by Sears and Lampert advisers, the people said.
When it finally began, Ray Schrock, the Weil lawyer representing Sears, had an announcement: ""We have what we believe is some very good news for Sears and its stakeholders,"" he said.Lampert had increased his bid to roughly $5 billion.
He agreed to take on more than $600 million in additional Sears liabilities, mainly bills for merchandise and taxes, and employee severance benefits.'FILL OR KILL'The following Monday morning, Jan. 14, advisers for Sears and Lampert entered the General Motors Building and rode elevators to Weil's offices for the start of the auction with the recently enhanced bid in hand.But that evening, Sears advisers at Weil's offices made an aggressive move: a demand known in Wall Street deal negotiating parlance as ""fill or kill."" The retailer wanted another $225 million to cover its bankruptcy costs, and Lampert needed to agree or abandon his takeover plan, people involved in the discussions said.""The goalposts have moved,"" a lawyer for Lampert complained.Nevertheless, the next morning, Lampert upped his bid.
Lampert would be allowed to use $1.3 billionSears owed him as currency in the offer, a maneuver known as a credit bid, which some creditors had opposed.At 12:45 a.m., Schrock, the Weil lawyer for Sears, said the company's board would consider the latest offer.",0,0.5198181818181818

462,"January 21, 2019, 07:05:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Starbucks (SBUX) Fiscal Q1 Earnings Preview,"
 Starbucks SBUX  has seen its stock price jump roughly 7% since Christmas, along with giants like Amazon AMZN  and much of the rest of the market. Now, the question is can the coffee firm's recent run of success continue with Starbucks set to report its quarterly financial results after the closing bell Thursday.  Overview  Last quarter, Starbucks' global comparable store sales popped 3%. This growth was driven by a 4% jump in the average ticket. More specifically, U.S. comps popped 4%, while same-store sales rose 1% in China. Overall, the coffee giant's fiscal Q4 revenues surged 10.6% and its loyalty program's active U.S. membership climbed 15% to 15.3 million. On top of the firm's growing rewards program, which helps create brand loyalty, Starbucks' mobile order and pay unit accounted for 14% of total U.S. company-operated transactions. Going forward, Starbucks' ability to expand its mobile order business could prove key and help it take on rival Dunkin' DNKN  . With that said, investors should note that Starbucks executives said in December that it plans to expand coffee delivery across the U.S. with UberEats. The firm has been testing delivery in Miami and plans to  begin to offer delivery at nearly a quarter of its more than 8,000 U.S. company-operated stores early this year. At this point, everyone from Walmart WMT  and Target TGT  to McDonald's MCD  have jumped into delivery-though hot coffee does present somewhat unique challenges. Starbucks' delivery business has already grown quickly in the vital Chinese market, through a partnership with Alibaba BABA  . With that said, some analysts and investors are worried that Apple's AAPL  Chinese slowdown could signal a similar downturn for everyone from Starbucks to Nike NKE  .     Fiscal Q1 Outlook  Moving on, Starbucks' first-quarter revenues are projected to climb by 6.8% to reach $6.49 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. We should note that this would mark a significant slowdown compared to Q4's nearly 11% top-line expansion. Maybe more importantly, however, our NFM estimate calls for SBUX's quarterly comparable store sales to pop 3%. This would match Q4's expansion and top the year-ago period's 2% climb. Meanwhile, at the other end of the income statement, SBUX's adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to come in flat from the prior-year quarter at $0.65 per share. We should also note that the company has seen some positive earnings estimate revision activity recently for Q1.     Bottom Line  Starbucks is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment based, in part, on its recen t earnings  revision trends. The company also sports an overall ""A"" VGM score, driven by its ""A"" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. It is also worth noting that SBUX stock moved mostly sideways over the last three years until its summer-2018 surge. Starbucks is scheduled to release its fiscal Q1 2019 financial results   after the market closes  this Thursday, January 24.

463,"January 22, 2019, 12:01:00 AM EDT",AMZN,,Amazon.com starts direct sales of merchandise in Brazil after delays,"


Reuters

@media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}



By Gabriela Mello
SAO PAULO, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc  is launching its long-awaited in-house fulfillment and delivery network in Brazil after months of delays caused by complicated logistics and a highly complex tax system in the largest Latin American economy.
Amazon, which some rivals had expected to kick off direct sales of items beyond books as soon as the Christmas selling season, said it will directly sell 11 categories of merchandise from over 800 suppliers from L'Oreal  to Black & Decker as of Tuesday.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
""We are launching (our direct sales platform) with 320,000 different products in stock, including 200,000 books... Our obsession is always to increase this catalog and to have everything Brazilian consumers seek and want to buy on the internet"", Amazon's Brazilian country manager Alex Szapiro told Reuters.
In November, Reuters reported that Amazon's attempt to advance with its so-called Fulfillment by Amazon program in Brazil had run into difficulties such as the nations's tangled tax system, complicated logistics and testy relations with some prominent vendors. 
""As in every negotiation, you take a seat at a table and you want to agree on the best possible terms"", said Szapiro when asked on the tone of conversations with suppliers, without entering in details.
Amazon entered Brazil quietly in 2012, selling e-readers, books and then streaming movies in the fast-growing Brazilian market. The company made its first big move into merchandise in October 2017, when it began offering the use of its Brazilian website to third-party merchants to sell electronics.
The company does not reveal the number of sellers in its marketplace, which it has slowly expanded over the past year, adding new categories while laying the ground for a direct sales platform.
As part of the fulfillment program, Amazon leased a 47,000 square-meter (505,904-square-foot) warehouse just outside of Sao Paulo, as first reported by Reuters almost a year ago. 
Szapiro, who previously worked as Brazil country manager for Apple Inc, declined to say how much the company is spending on the new distribution center or how many people it is hiring, but said Amazon employs directly and indirectly over 1,400 people in Brazil.
In a report published on Monday, analysts at investment bank BTG Pactual said the expected direct sales launch signaled the company was ready ""to strengthen investments, potentially via more partnerships with fulfillment operators and last-mile carriers.""
Even though the bank predicted Amazon would take a ""gradual approach"" and was likely to vye for a ""low double-digit market share,"" shares of Brazilian retailers reacted negatively to BTG's report, with B2W, Magazine Luiza  e Lojas Americanas  among the biggest losers in Monday's session.

464,"January 21, 2019, 05:18:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,AT&T (T) Q4 Earnings Preview,"
 Shares of AT&T T  have surged over 13% since Christmas along with much of the market. With that said, AT&T stock is still down 18% in the last year as investors wait to see what to make of its Time Warner acquisition and how it adapts in a new entertainment age as it prepares to challenge Netflix NFLX  with its own streaming offering. With that said, let's see what to expect from AT&T's Q4 financial results that are due out Wednesday, January 30.  Overview  AT&T completed its purchase of Time Warner last June in a deal worth roughly $81 billion, but the Department of Justice is still trying to fight the merger. The company's purchase brings Warner Bros. film studio along with CNN, HBO, and other properties under the A&T umbrella, which already includes DirectTV and its wireless business. Looking ahead, AT&T has joined the 5G race along with the likes of Verizon VZ  and T-Mobile TMUS  . In fact, the wireless giant grabbed headlines recently after it put ""5GE"" labels on top of some customers' Android smartphone screens. AT&T said  the E stands for ""evolution."" AT&T has also said that is will launch a new stand-alone, direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 in order to further challenge Netflix, Amazon AMZN  and soon enough Disney DIS  and Apple AAPL  . The company plans to include HBO content on its offering that will be separate from the DirecTV Now and its lower-cost WatchTV (also read: Netflix Q4 Earnings Call: Content, Debt, Disney, YouTube & More  ).     Outlook  Looking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for A&T's fourth-quarter revenues to surge 16.2% to reach $48.42 billion. Last quarter, the firm's revenues popped 15.3% from the year-ago period, with much of the growth driven by its Time Warner acquisition. This, however, fell short of Wall Street estimates. We can see that prior to 2015, AT&T's revenues hadn't climbed much for almost eight straight years until it purchased DirectTV that summer.    At the bottom end of the income statement, AT&T's adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to jump 8.97% to touch $0.85 per share. The wireless and entertainment power's adjusted earnings surged 21.6% in Q3, which also failed to top estimates.  Earnings Trends  Moving on, investors should note that AT&T has received some mixed earnings estimate revision activity over the last 60 days. With that said, we can see that these revisions have only moved upward over the past 30 days, which includes some positivity in the last week.   This means that at least some analysts are more positive about AT&T's quarterly earnings results than they were not too long ago, which could be a good sign.    AT&T is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports ""A"" grades for both Value and Momentum in our Style scores System. AT&T is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results before the market opens on Wednesday, January 30.

465,"January 21, 2019, 05:03:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,The Latest Slide in Children's Place Stock Makes No Sense,"
 What happens to a stock when its company's biggest rival goes   bankrupt? According to Wall Street, it goes down. That was the case earlier this week when news broke that   Gymboree, the biggest direct competitor of   Children's Place    (NASDAQ: PLCE) , would file for bankruptcy. Shares of Children's Place, the largest pure-play children's   specialty apparel retailer in North America, fell 4.5% on Jan. 15   as news broke that Gymboree would file for Chapter 11 for the   second time in less than two years; it was expected to close   around 800 stores in total. On Jan. 17, when Gymboree actually   filed for Chapter 11, the company said it would close its   Gymboree and Crazy 8 stores, and attempt to sell its 139-store   high-end Janie & Jack chain, as well as Gymboree's   intellectual property and website.makeArticleAd(); The market's reaction to the news, selling off Children's   Place stock and pushing it to a two-year low, can only have one   of two reasons. First, investors fear that short-term performance   will be impacted by liquidation sales at Gymboree, something   Children's Place acknowledged in its third-quarter earnings   report when it lowered its full-year guidance. The other possible   reason is that the market sees Gymboree's bankruptcy as a red   flag for the broader children's-apparel retail sector, as   brick-and-mortar stores have been challenged in recent years.   However, this line of reasoning makes little sense as Children's   Place is in a much stronger position than its bankrupt rival.   Children's Place reported comparable-sales growth of 9.5% in its   most recent quarter, and the company is solidly profitable with   an 8.6% operating profit margin in its most recent fiscal year.   Children's Place has also built a strong e-commerce program with   29% of its revenue coming from the online channel, showing   e-commerce has been a source of growth for the company rather   than a threat.   Image source: Getty Images.  A brief history lesson There have been plenty of retail bankruptcies in recent years   as several chains have been pressured by changing consumer habits   and the rise of e-commerce, especially of   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) . The record on how surviving competitors   performed is mixed, but there's little evidence that competitor   bankruptcies are bad for other industry operators. Let's take a   look at a few cases.  Dick's Sporting Goods    (NYSE: DKS) , the country's leading sporting-goods retailer, has   weathered a wave of competitor failures in recent years,   including The Sports Authority, Eastern Mountain Sports, Gander   Mountain, City Sports, and Bob's -- ample evidence that the   industry was oversaturated. After Dick's stock rose in 2016 on   anticipation that it would capitalize on those opportunities,   which included taking over stores from Sports Authority, it   plunged 45%    in 2017 as Dick's performance did not meet expectations and sales   growth was underwhelming. Today, Dick's remains stable and   profitable, but the stock has not recovered from the 2017 slide   and is trading near five-year lows.  Best Buy    (NYSE: BBY) , on the other hand, has been an undeniable success   story despite considerable pressure on electronics retail over   the years from Amazon and others. While competitors like Circuit   City and H.H. Gregg have fallen by the wayside, Best Buy found a   way to thwart the   showrooming effect    with a combination of price-matching, better customer service,   shop-in-store formats, and a focus on services with the help of   Geek Squad. As a result, the stock has more than quadrupled since   it hit bottom at the end of 2012, when ""showrooming"" worries   peaked. Best Buy remains healthy today, with comparable sales up   4.3% in its most recent quarter, and adjusted earnings per share   increasing 19%. Finally, when Borders filed for bankruptcy in 2011, many   thought that   Barnes & Noble    's (NYSE: BKS) days were numbered. The stock slipped below $10   for the first time ever that year, but the bookstore chain has   bucked expectations that it would go belly-up. While Barnes &   Noble stock has continued to struggle (it trades around $6 a   share today), the company continues to operate more than 600   stores nationwide, embracing toys and games to support the   buffeted book business, and even saw solid growth during the   holiday season as comparable sales jumped 4%. It's also opening   new small-format, community-focused stores. On a GAAP (generally   accepted accounting principles) basis, B&N isn't profitable,   but it's targeting $175 million to $200 million in EBITDA   (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization)   profit for the current fiscal year. While the bookstore chain is   hardly thriving, no other company has faced the wrath of Amazon   more than Barnes & Noble. That it is still operating hundreds   of stores today, and even opening new ones, shows that   expectations of its demise after Borders died were   wrongheaded. What it means for Children's Place There are no perfect analogies in business, but it's hard to   conclude from the above stories that a rival's bankruptcy is a   bad thing for a surviving retailer. It may not necessarily be a   boon, as evidenced by Dick's struggles. But Children's Place is   in a stronger position than any of the retailers above at the   time their competitors went out of business, so it's better   prepared to capitalize on Gymboree's faltering. In December, when   Gymboree said it would close a significant number of its stores,   Children's Place said in its following   earnings call    that it was targeting $100 million in market-share gains. With   nearly all of Gymboree's stores now closing, that number could   double. While some short-term headwinds due to liquidation sales are   expected, a year from now Children's Place will likely be in a   stronger position thanks to Gymboree's exit. With the stock   already looking cheap    and a number of other initiatives underway to further improve the   underlying business, the Gymboree-inspired sell-off in Children's   Place stock looks like a mistake.   10 stocks we like better than The Children's     Place       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

On Jan. 17, when Gymboree actually   filed for Chapter 11, the company said it would close its   Gymboree and Crazy 8 stores, and attempt to sell its 139-store   high-end Janie & Jack chain, as well as Gymboree's   intellectual property and website.makeArticleAd(); The market's reaction to the news, selling off Children's   Place stock and pushing it to a two-year low, can only have one   of two reasons.
First, investors fear that short-term performance   will be impacted by liquidation sales at Gymboree, something   Children's Place acknowledged in its third-quarter earnings   report when it lowered its full-year guidance.
The other possible   reason is that the market sees Gymboree's bankruptcy as a red   flag for the broader children's-apparel retail sector, as   brick-and-mortar stores have been challenged in recent years.
Children's Place reported comparable-sales growth of 9.5% in its   most recent quarter, and the company is solidly profitable with   an 8.6% operating profit margin in its most recent fiscal year.
In December, when   Gymboree said it would close a significant number of its stores,   Children's Place said in its following   earnings call    that it was targeting $100 million in market-share gains.

466,"January 21, 2019, 05:03:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,3 Investing Trends to Watch in 2019,"
 There have been a few trends that have gained steam over the   past few years and are shaping up to become even bigger in 2019.   For those who've been paying close attention to the technology,   automotive, and healthcare industries, you've likely noticed that   artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, and cannabis growing   are three stock ideas that just can't seem to stay out of the   headlines. Like most investment trends, betting on these trends early is   better than holding off for too long. You might have to stomach   some volatility as they grow, but there's no mistaking that each   offers its own unique investing opportunity.   Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();   Trend 1: Artificial intelligence  AI has the potential to bring truly transformative   technologies to market, some of which we're already beginning to   see. For example,   Alphabet    's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) self-driving car company,   Waymo, recently launched the   first commercial autonomous ride-hailing   service    just last month. Waymo's technology is primarily controlled by   artificial intelligence systems    that process visual information from cameras and sensors to give   the autonomous vehicles sight. Waymo's service is still in the early stages, but estimates   have put the company's potential market value at $70 billion.  Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) is also knee-deep in AI and already uses machine   learning, a type of artificial intelligence, for the speech and   image recognition services it provides through its Amazon Web   Service (AWS) cloud-computing platform. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has   also   highlighted the use of machine learning    to improve how the company forecasts product demand, product   search rankings on its website, and deal recommendations. Amazon's AI integration is an example of how businesses will   implement AI over the coming years, and as they do, they'll   create $3.9 trillion in global business value (including cost   reductions, new revenue streams, and better user experiences) by   2022, according to   Gartner    . And that might just be the tip of AI's full potential.   Artificial intelligence could add $15.7 trillion to the global   economy by 2030, according to PwC.  Trend 2: Electric vehicles  This one might seem like an odd trend to highlight, but recent   moves by   General Motors    (NYSE: GM) indicate that electric vehicles are on their way to   becoming more mainstream. The company announced back in November   that it was laying off some of its workers in part so that it can   focus attention on making a new platform    for electric vehicles (EVs). GM is expected to release the first EV on the new platform in   late 2021 or early 2022, and it will eventually use it across its   Cadillac, Buick, and Chevrolet brands, though its initial EV   focus in the U.S. will be on Cadillac vehicles. The pivot to EVs   is a big one for GM, and the move may be partially influenced by   the rise of EV sales in China, which is the largest automotive   market. Electric vehicle sales in the country already outpace   those in the U.S. Of course, no discussion about EVs is complete without   mentioning   Tesla    (NASDAQ: TSLA) . Despite a   a year of controversies    in 2018 involving the company's CEO Elon Musk, Tesla was able to   steadily increase deliveries of its Model 3 from 1,550 in the   fourth quarter of 2017 to an impressive 63,150 in the fourth   quarter of 2018. The jump in Tesla Model 3 deliveries over the past year prove   that the company -- and EVs in general -- are only beginning to   find traction. It's worth pointing out that there's still a long   road ahead for Tesla. Musk recently said that he's laying off 7%   of the company's workforce while still aiming to increase Model 3   production. Over the next few years, EV sales are poised to take off. The   latest estimates from J.P. Morgan show that global sales of   electric vehicles will reach 8.4 million units in 2025, up from   just 1 million in 2016. And with those increases, EVs will create   a $567 billion market that same year.  Trend 3: The cannabis industry        And finally, one of the biggest trends many investors are   watching right now is the cannabis industry. Much of the   excitement around this market comes from what's happening in   Canada, where the sale of marijuana to adult individuals for   recreational use is now legal across the country. The opening up of the cannabis market in the country has   caused the share price of the few publicly traded Canadian   marijuana growers to skyrocket recently. For example, shares of   Canopy Growth, Inc.    (NYSE: CGC) ,   one of the largest cannabis growers    in Canada, have popped 60% over the past six months. Investors   are optimistic about a   $4 billion investment    the company received from   Constellation Brands    (NYSE: STZ) , one of the world's largest alcoholic beverage   companies, in mid-2018. Canopy also recently made a move to begin   selling   hemp-based consumer goods    in the U.S. that's sparked investor optimism. Another big player in marijuana stocks is   Aurora Cannabis    (NYSE: ACB) , which is one of the   top cannabis-producing companies    . Aurora is benefiting from medical marijuana sales in countries   around the world and has expanded its reach recently through   several important acquisitions. Aurora's stock, like most   marijuana stocks, remains highly volatile but has lots of   potential. The worldwide legal cannabis market is   expected to grow to $194 billion    by 2025, and if current trends continue in the U.S., America's   marijuana market will be worth $23.4 billion by 2022.  How to follow these trends        It's impossible to predict how these trends will grow, of   course. But there's no denying that electric vehicles, artificial   intelligence, and the cannabis industry are hot markets getting   lots of attention right now. In the coming years, it's likely investors will continue to   hear more about these markets as more companies use AI to improve   their businesses, as EV sales continue to grab more automotive   market share, and as more countries (namely, the U.S.) expand   legal cannabis sales. For investors looking to benefit from some   of the biggest trends available right now, each of the companies   mentioned above is worth a closer look.   10 stocks we like better than Canopy Growth     Corp.

467,"January 21, 2019, 03:12:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Bluetooth-Connected Adapt BB Smart Shoes & Nike's Digital Future,"
     Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research where Associate Stock Strategist Ben Rains breaks down Nike's NKE  new self-lacing, Bluetooth-connected Adapt BB shoes. The episode then dives into how the Adapt BB smart sneakers work into Nike's larger digital future as the sportswear giant races to expand its e-commerce sales. Nike officially introduced its new Adapt BB shoes last week after teasing them over the last month. The firm debuted the new self-lacing futuristic shoes on the heels of CES where the likes of Google GOOGL  and other tech giants introduce their latest offerings and tease the technology they have coming down the pipeline. The Adapt BB basketball sneakers look pretty normal, but they are set to retail for $350 and offer a glimpse into the future of our increasingly connected lives. Nike's Adapt BB shoes connect to an app and must be charged. Therefore, they might not be the most practical offering for the everyday consumer right now. But the shoes have already been worn in real NBA games and seem to offer legitimate health benefits. Nike plans to roll out its FitAdapt technology beyond basketball for years to come. And for those who think this is a little bit of a gimmick, remember that Apple AAPL  CEO Tim Cook recently said that he thinks his company's most significant contribution to the world will likely be on the health front. With that said, Nike's new Adapt BB smart shoes are also part of the company's larger digital push. Nike has rolled out numerous apps and it crushes its peers like Adidas ADDYY  and Under Armour UAA  in terms of reach across social media from Instagram FB  to Twitter TWTR  , in an age where users shop more and more from their phones. In fact, Nike CFO Andy Campion said recently that Nike expects its digital division will comprise 30% of the firm's total business by 2023, compared to roughly 15% at the moment. Despite Nike's e-commerce expansion and partnerships with companies like Alibaba BABA  and increased presence on Amazon AMZN  , CEO Mark Parker is committed to continuing its strategic partnerships with Foot Locker FL  , Nordstrom JWN  , and Dick's Sporting Goods DKS  . Overall, Nike is ready to remain the biggest sportswear company in world by constantly evolving and innovating as it faces more competition from the likes of Lululemon LULU  , Gap GPS  , and other non-traditional sportswear brands.   As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

468,"January 21, 2019, 03:03:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,"Microsoft (MSFT) Earnings Preview: Cloud, Personal Computing & More","
 Microsoft MSFT  stock has surged over 14% since Christmas as part of the larger market resurgence. In order for the tech powerhouse to continue its run, it will likely have to impress investors with solid fiscal second quarter 2019 financial results. So, let's see what we should expect from Microsoft's top and bottom line, as well as some of its specific business units, including Intelligent Cloud, before the company reports its earnings results on Wednesday, January 30.  Quick Overview  Microsoft, Apple AAPL  , Amazon AMZN  and Google parent Alphabet GOOGL  continue to fight for the title of the world's most valuable company. Still, no matter how fun this back and forth race for market cap supremacy might be, investors really care that MSFT has been able to grow its core businesses, while also expanding its reach in the new digital age. For starters, Microsoft grabbed roughly 15%  of the cloud market last quarter to top IBM IBM  , Google, and Alibaba BABA  and come in second to Amazon. We should also note that the company's gaming business has expanded recently. Plus, CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft made 15 acquisitions  last year, highlighted by its $7.5 billion purchase of open-sourced software platform Github, which should help the company continue to expand into new growth areas.     Outlook  Microsoft's second-quarter revenues are projected to climb 12.2% to hit $32.45 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Last quarter, MSFT's revenues surged by 19% to reach $29.1 billion. Meanwhile, the tech company's adjusted quarterly earnings are expected to surge 13.5% to reach $1.09 per share. Now we need to understand what to expect from Microsoft's individual business units as they could determine how MSFT stock trades, especially in the near-term. To understand what to expect from these vital units we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.  Productivity & Business Processes  Microsoft's Productivity & Business Processes unit features the firm's Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics CRM businesses. The company is projected to see its revenues jump 12.8% from $8.953 billion to reach $10.096 billion, based on our current NFM consensus estimates. Last quarter, Productivity & Business Processes revenues surged 19%, while unit revenues climbed 25% in the year-ago period. So clearly the firm's fiscal second-quarter revenues would mark a slowdown compared to recent periods.  Intelligent Cloud  Moving on, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud is projected to surge over 19% from $7.795 billion to hit $9.295 billion. We should note that Intelligent Cloud has become one of MSFT's most important units and is comprised of the company's server and enterprise products. This segment also includes its much talked about Azure unit. With that said, Intelligent Cloud climbed 24% last quarter and popped 15% in the year-ago period.     More Personal Computing  We close with a look at what is still Microsoft's largest business segment, More Personal Computing. The division that features Microsoft Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search is projected to see its revenues reach $13.086 billion. This would mark a roughly 7.5% climb from the prior-year quarter's $12.170 billion, which itself was up only 2%. Clearly, our estimate represents solid growth compared to Q2 2018, but it would mark a sequential slowdown compared to Q1's 15% expansion. This growth was driven by its Xbox-fueled gaming segment, which soared 44% as its Netflix NFLX  -style Xbox Game Pass grew in popularity. Microsoft is currently scheduled to report its Q2 fiscal 2019 earnings results after the closing bell on Wednesday, January 30. Make sure to check back here for our full analysis of Microsoft's actual financial results after the company reports.

469,"January 21, 2019, 02:14:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,"Apple Roundup: Watch, Verizon Deal, Privacy, Regulatory","
 Here are the top Apple AAPL  stories from last week:  Apple Watch for Seniors  As part of its big push into preventive healthcare, Apple is in talks with at least three private Medicare plans to cover/subsidize its Watch for senior citizens above 65 years of age. CNBC reports that there are around 19 million prospects (under the Medicare Advantage plan) that could be encouraged to wear such a device to track their health condition and take appropriate action to prevent a stroke or heart attack among other things. At the very least, such action may be able to reduce the number of visits to the emergency room. Like Amazon AMZN  , which is also trying to reduce the overall cost of healthcare, Apple's measures are designed to rope in insurance companies because they are the ones that stand to gain financially from fewer hospital visits. Other than people of course, but they may not want to go in for another $400 gadget, never mind that it can do fall detection, ECG, atrial fibrillation and such. With Medicare, the government pays around $10,000 per member for providing services to seniors and wouldn't it be neat if this money could pay or subsidize the Watch. So now, Apple needs to demonstrate that the devices actually do what they promise. Which is why it's doing a heart study with Stanford University and why it's partnered with Zimmer Biomet to prove speedier recovery from knee and hip replacement procedures using the Watch. And then, there's Johnson & Johnson, with which it's doing a study to see how a J&J app works with Apple's Watch to detect and diagnose irregular heart rhythms, or atrial fibrillation, so customers can visit a doctor, get into a suitable healthcare plan or change their lifestyle as appropriate. ""We're just at the front end of this,"" Cook said in a CNBC interview. ""But I do think, looking back, in the future, you will answer that question: Apple's most important contribution to mankind has been in health.""  Verizon Pulls Closer to Apple  Apple Music subscribers are swelling and Verizon's VZ  inclusion of the service in its premium bundles (Beyond Unlimited at $85 a month and Above Unlimited at $95 a month) will bring further growth. Verizon is offering the Apple service free, which makes it all the more attractive. Including Apple not only brings its 50 million songs to Verizon premium subscribers for streaming across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, HomePod, CarPlay, PCs and Android devices, but also sets the stage for later collaboration on video as Apple continues to splurge on original content. Its peers T-Mobile offers Netflix, Sprint offers Hulu while AT&T offers its own HBO Now service as well as other options. Adding Verizon customers immediately boosts Apple subscribers with much-needed service revenue to follow. What's more, this creates the basic framework for distribution of video content when Apple's original productions are ready. Verizon being late to pick up a partner here has actually worked well for Apple.  Tim Cook on Privacy  Apple, the A in the FAANG story never misses an opportunity to take pot shots at Facebook FB  and Alphabet GOOGL  , the F and the G. Apple doesn't depend on ad sales, so minimizes the amount of information it carries on its users, especially in unencrypted form. So it's hard for these companies to shout back at Apple. Here are snippets from Apple CEO Tim Cook's op-ed for Time magazine, written for ""comprehensive federal privacy legislation"" - ""One of the biggest challenges in protecting privacy is that many of the violations are invisible."" ""Consumers shouldn't have to tolerate another year of companies irresponsibly amassing huge user profiles, data breaches that seem out of control and the vanishing ability to control our own digital lives."" ""Technology has the potential to keep changing the world for the better, but it will never achieve that potential without the full faith and confidence of the people who use it."" ""All of these secondary markets for your information exist in a shadow economy that's largely unchecked -- out of sight of consumers, regulators and lawmakers,"" Cook wrote. ""Let's be clear: you never signed up for that."" ""The Federal Trade Commission should establish a data-broker clearinghouse, requiring all data brokers to register, enabling consumers to track the transactions that have bundled and sold their data from place to place, and giving users the power to delete their data on demand, freely, easily and online, once and for all.""  Germany Sides with Apple vs. Qualcomm  The regional court in the city of Mannheim dismissed the first of six patent infringement lawsuits brought by Qualcomm QCOM  against Apple in Mannheim. After adverse rulings in Munich and Fuzhou (China), Apple temporarily removed the older model iPhones in dispute while keeping its latest models on sale in the country. The second ruling is slated for next month. As may be expected, Qualcomm said it would appeal while Apple said it was happy with the decision. A separate court decision in Munich earlier banned the German sale of Apple's iPhone 7 and 8.  Apple report  edly also received a negative ruling in China for its iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X. However, last November, Qualcomm was also handed a defeat by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which also ordered it to make its essential technology for modem chips available to rivals, as requested by the U.S. ITC. There's a maze of litigation going on out there. As far as investors are concerned, there's unlikely to be any major impact on Apple in the foreseeable future. And since neither party is expected to back down right now, it's a good thing that the financial impact that won't be material for Apple.

470,"January 21, 2019, 08:31:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,What's in Store for STMicroelectronics (STM) in Q4 Earnings?,"
  STMicroelectronics N.V. STM  is slated to report fourth-quarter 2018 results on Jan 24. Notably, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters but missed the same once, delivering average positive surprise of 7.08%. In the las t report  ed quarter,   STMicroelectronics report  ed non-GAAP earnings of 41 cents per share, which increased 57.7% year over year and 41.4% sequentially. Net revenues also increased 18.1% year over year to $2.52 billion. The top-line growth was driven by robust performance in Imaging, Power Discrete and Automotive products. For the fourth quarter, the company expects net revenues to grow approximately 5.7% sequentially. Shares of STMicroelectronics have lost 41.6% in the past year compared with its industry  's decline of 12.1%.        Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.  Factors to Consider  The company's well-performing products will continue to aid its performance across all end markets in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, the company's higher-value products will continue to contribute to top-line growth in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, STMicroelectronics remains optimistic about its strong momentum across industrial, automotive and personal electronics markets, thanks to the growing demand for smartphone applications. The company's robust microcontrollers, sensors, power, analog and other connectivity products will continue to aid its top line in the industrial market in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, the growing proliferation of smartphones, 32-bit microcontrollers, flight and motion sensors, touchscreen controllers, as well as protection devices will continue to drive the company's performance in the personal electronics market. Further, increasing usage of electronic applications in cars, especially in smart cars and autonomous vehicles, remains a positive for the company's solid growth in the automotive market. STMicroelectronics' expanding design wins for its silicon carbide products will continue to drive top-line growth from this particular market. Also, in the areas of braking, body control and engine management, the company continues to witness growing contract wins. This is helping STMicroelectronics to sustain its momentum in the automotive market. However, weak pricing power pressure on the chip market, especially for the NAND flash memory, along with increasing levels of inventory continue to be overhangs. Also, the ongoing trade tension regarding tariffs between the United States and China, and growing U.S. protectionism are major headwinds, which are raising volatility in the semiconductor market.

471,"January 21, 2019, 08:13:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,5 Fast-Growing AI Stocks to Win Big in 2019,"
 Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to be red hot, with its influence growing on various industries throughout the world. AI helps improve almost everything, including advertising, healthcare, robotics, retail, video streaming, gaming and urban development, to name a few.  AI expert Andrew Ng, in fact, had compared AI to the next electricity saying that ""just as electricity transformed almost everything 100 years ago, today I actually have a hard time thinking of an industry that I don't think AI will transform in the next several years."" It is now widely used in autonomous cars or smart electronic gadgets, which should help AI stocks see more ups than downs in the near future. Lest we forget, AI spending will see an average compounded annual rate of 18% to $383.5 billion by 2020, per Gartner estimates. Several Wall Street analysts expect AI-related revenues to climb from an estimated $7.35 billion last year to nearly $90 billion in 2025, primarily on the evolution of self-driven cars and smart devices. With AI here to stay, let us look at the top five AI stocks that investors could benefit from.  salesforce.com Makes Big Leap  Cloud computing behemoth, salesforce.com, inc.

The company has outperformed the broader industry so far this year (+11.3% vs +7.3%).     Intel's Big Chip Opening   Intel Corporation INTC  is known for its long dividend payment history. It is one of the best dividend payers, by the way, in the entire tech industry and has consistently raised the dividend payout over the years. Now, Intel's venture into AI should certainly boost dividend growth. In 2018, the company sold $1 billion worth of AI chips, which is projected to generate a solid $10 billion in sales by 2022. Intel has made solid advances in AI-centric markets. Since the acquisition of the Mobileye, it is much into the self-driving space. The company is also providing chips to Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGL  self-driving subsidiary, Waymo. Looking ahead, Intel is planning to launch a commercial self-driving taxi service along with Volkswagen in Israel. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2.

      For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - January 21, 2019 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL  , Johnson & Johnson JNJ  , Amazon AMZN  and Alphabet's GOOGL  .  Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:    Apple Expands in Healthcare, Partners Johnson &     Johnson    Apple  recently partnered with Johnson & Johnson for a multi-year research study aimed at early detection of irregular heart conditions. Expected to be initiated in 2019, the study will examine users aged above 65in the United States. Notably, both the companies and third-party providers will not have access to patient-identifiable information, per Johnson. Janssen Pharmaceuticals, one of Johnson's research and development (R&D) companies, will place its app on the Apple Watch 4 to detect atrial fibrillation (AFib) thereby helping with early stroke detection. Notably, Apple Watch 4, which primarily focuses on heart care, is the best and most accessible Apple Watch to date, per TechCrunch. The U.S. FDA cleared device has a built-in electrocardiogram (ECG) reader, enabling users to obtain a 30-second ECG reading to gain more insight into their health. Johnson & Johnson, which has a deep expertise in the study of cardiovascular diseases, is looking to reduce the number of people affected by heart problems by leveraging Apple's technology. Notably, about 33 million people worldwide die of heart diseases, per Apple and Johnson & Johnson.  Apple's Healthcare Initiatives  Apple is trying to penetrate the healthcare market owing to the huge potential it promises. Notably, more than $7 trillion per year is spent  globally on health care, which is almost 10% of global GDP. Apple's software developer kits (SDKs) are helping developers and researchers conduct research trials to better study patient care. The open source ResearchKit and CareKit allow developers to create apps that work with the Apple ecosystem. While users perform tasks, iPhone sensors collect their data, with consent, to better monitor medical conditions and give deeper insights into their medical records. This is more relevant with extreme medical conditions like asthma attack/ epileptic seizure where the existing data can be used to predict a future attack. Apple is also bringing many features to its health application. The iPhone maker updated the Health Record section of its Health application by partnering with several healthcare communities. This update, which is based on FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) technology, enables users to easily access medical records, lab reports and other crucial information from multiple care providers like hospitals and clinics, physicians, and other relevant parties. Players like Amazon, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and Fitbit are showing interest  in strengthening their presence in the healthcare industry too. Especially, Amazon's focus on delivering  quality services at affordable cost is disrupting the multi-trillion dollar healthcare industry. Nevertheless, Apple's secure data practices coupled with its brand image might give it an edge in the healthcare market, where user data privacy is of utmost important. Apple currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)   stocks here.    Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

473,"January 21, 2019, 07:00:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Is Amazon Set for Grocery Success During a Recession?,"
 A tumultuous end to 2018 and a slow start to 2019 have some   market analysts whispering about a threat that was seldom   mentioned during the longest bull market run in financial   history: a recession. And while a recession is far from a sure   thing, it's worth looking at how one might affect   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) , a company like no other. No company can count on doing particularly well in a   recession, but certain subsets of the economy are known to be   better insulated than others. One such subset is the grocery   store business,   which tends to weather recessions reasonably   well    as people have to buy food no matter how the economy is doing.   Amazon is certainly not a grocery store, but it does own one   (Whole Foods), and it does sell groceries on Amazon.com. Can   those holdings become a hedge against possible economic   downturns?   Source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  How groceries fit into Amazon's business strategy Amazon started as an online bookstore, but it quickly shed the   limitations that came with that and became an ""everything store.""   If it could be shipped, Amazon would sell it (or would help a   third party to sell it to you) on Amazon.com. And as Amazon grew   and leveraged its size while cutting shipping deals, more and   more things became cost-effective to ship. Those included   groceries and home supplies such as detergent, which Amazon   started selling under its      Prime Pantry    program. (Amazon also sold things that were   not    cost-effective to ship, but it has recently   made efforts to become more profit-minded with   its offerings    .) Amazon acquired Whole Foods in 2017. In the deal valued at   $13.7 billion, Amazon gained everything Whole Foods had to offer,   from its branding to its 475 brick-and-mortar grocery stores.   Amazon is   planning to add more    Whole Foods stores around the U.S. In addition to its physical grocery store options, Amazon is   pushing hard in the online grocery shopping market. Whole Foods   groceries can be ordered from Amazon Fresh and Prime Now, which   are Amazon's grocery delivery and same-day delivery programs,   respectively; and Whole Foods groceries are no longer available   through online delivery competitor Instacart. All of this matters to Amazon, but it's important to keep   perspective and remember just how big Amazon is. Amazon   hit $1 trillion in market cap    last fall. It's worth more like $815 billion as of this writing,   but that's still nearly 60 times the value of the Whole Foods   deal. In the third quarter of 2018,   Amazon reported    $4.25 billion worth of sales from all of its physical stores   (including its bookstores, pop-up stores, and Whole Foods   stores), which was dwarfed by online sales of $29 billion. Of   course, Amazon sells groceries online, but   even Amazon optimists cite numbers    that put Amazon at $2 billion in total online grocery sales for   all of 2017. For comparison, Amazon Web Services brought in $6.68 billion   for Amazon just last quarter. With that said, Amazon is the top   dog in the online grocery sales market -- it's just that the   online grocery sales market isn't that big, at least not yet. That doesn't mean that it won't be nice for Amazon if its   groceries sell well during an economic downturn, but it does mean   that some perspective is useful. To be a meaningful hedge against   broader weakness, Amazon's grocery business will need to   grow. That ""whole paycheck"" image When thinking about how Amazon's grocery business will do in   an economic downturn, it's also worth noting that Whole Foods is   arguably not as well-positioned as other grocers to weather tough   economic times because of its higher prices. Consumers need groceries no matter how the economy is doing,   but Whole Foods is not a typical grocery brand. It's a premium   brand, and premium brands rely more on consumers' disposable   income. Whole Foods has only around 2.5% of the grocery store   market, which is well behind   Walmart    (NYSE: WMT) , a big Amazon rival that has more than 5,000   physical locations (more than 10 times as many as Whole Foods   has) and a 23% market share in groceries. Of course, Amazon can try to reposition its grocery offerings   -- especially online. Online grocery shopping and Amazon's future Right now, Amazon's grocery offerings don't seem like much of   a bulwark against recession. But the company is moving in the   right direction: As it grows its grocery business and targets   audiences less interested in premium grocery offerings, it is   getting a bit of insurance against troubled economic times and   turning up the heat on rival Walmart. Walmart still has the inside track, of course. It has far more   locations, and it is improving its online grocery shopping   options and delivery services. And while Amazon is ahead online,   groceries remain something that most people buy in person. Some   observers expect online grocery shopping to make up just   20% of all grocery sales by 2025    , leaving 80% of sales for in-person shopping. But 20% of grocery sales is still a lot of money, and Amazon   is in a position to dominate that market with an established   customer base and more than 100 million Amazon Prime subscribers   to work with.         10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

  F5 Networks Inc  . FFIV  is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jan 23.  makeArticleAd();  The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 6.45%.    In the las t report  ed quarter, the company's non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.90 increased 18.9% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.63. Moreover, F5 Networks' revenues grew 4.6% to $562.7 million and topped the consensus estimate of $560.7 million.    For first-quarter fiscal 2019, F5 Networks expects revenues in the range of $542-$552 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $546.65 million. The company expects non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $2.51-$2.54. The consensus estimate is pegged at $2.54.    Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.   F5 Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise        F5 Networks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise    |      F5 Networks, Inc. Quote    Factors at Play    F5 Networks' growth in services and software solutions segment is a key driver. The company's traction in public cloud deployments, given the surge in demand for security in the multi-cloud environment, is a tailwind.    Additionally, the company is also upping its public cloud expertise. The joining of former General Manager of Global Business Development and sale operations for Amazon's AMZN  AWS Marketplace, Barry Russell, as the head of its cloud sales team, in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 is expected to boost F5 Networks' expansion into multi-cloud opportunities globally.    The BIG-IP Cloud Edition had started gaining traction among customers immediately after its launch last year. This trend is expected to continue in the fiscal first quarter and drive revenues.    On the last   earnings call  , the company hinted that a key managed care provider has chosen F5 Networks' solutions, including the BIG-IP Cloud Edition, to aid its transition to the public cloud. This is expected to give impetus to the momentum further.    Moreover, the company stated that it is witnessing strong momentum in Enterprise License Agreements and Virtual Edition subscription software deals. The size of deals is increasing, allowing F5 Networks to expand its use cases and implement a new consumption model, which is expected to drive software growth. The software segment grew 19% year over year in the last quarter of fiscal 2018, and contributed 17% to product revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for product revenues in the fiscal first quarter is pegged at $237 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 4.4%.    Further, the company's growth opportunities in the security market are driven by its advanced Web Application Firewall (WAF). It is witnessing an expansion in its addressable market and revenue growth prospects on the back of its WAF offerings. The strong adoption of advanced WAF in existing as well as new customers is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.    The company, however, expects quarterly fluctuations in hardware sales despite demand for new hardware in emerging markets like China and Latin America.    A volatile spending environment and increasing competition remain headwinds for F5 Networks' revenue growth. Soft spending by tier 1 service providers in North America is a concern.    Additionally, increasing competition remain headwinds for F5 Networks' revenue growth. Notably, Cisco Systems CSCO  poses the most significant competitive threat to F5 Networks, given the dominance of the former in the overall networking market.

Jan 21 (Reuters) - Eddie Stobart Logistics  is starting a rail service from the London port of Tilbury to Daventry, where major retailers including Amazon  have distribution centres, as uncertainty rises over Brexit.
British Prime Minister Theresa May's government has warned that failure to strike a European Union exit deal will lead to severe disruption and has implemented tests to Europe's busiest ferry port at Dover. 
The new Tilbury to Daventry rail service will have a capacity of 200 containers a week, Eddie Stobart, which operates 3,800 trailers in Britain and continental Europe, said.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Tilbury is a natural distribution hub, with 18 million people living within a 75 miles radius and transport links to and from London and across the South East, its owner Forth Ports says.
Eddie Stobart said last week it expects margins to improve further in 2019 as it continues to invest in transport operations, warehousing network and technology to support its future growth plans.

476,"January 20, 2019, 05:16:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,This Analyst's Amazon Suggestion Makes a Lot of Sense,"
 Omnichannel retail has the potential to drive big gains for   e-commerce companies, as it taps consumers on multiple fronts and   provides them with an integrated shopping experience. There's no rocket science behind this concept. Suppose your   car is low on gas and you have to make a run to the gas station.   Wouldn't it be great if you could order groceries on the   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) smartphone app and pick them up at an Amazon gas   station? Well, that's something the e-commerce giant should look   at, according  to investment banking firm D.A. Davidson, as   reported by   Bloomberg    .   Could Amazon one day sell you gas? Image Source: Getty     ImagesmakeArticleAd();   Why gas stations?  Bloomberg reports that D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte   believes that the addition of gas stations would give Amazon   ""thousands of commercial locations to advance its delivery   efforts,"" as well as help the company generate revenue from   gasoline sales. This looks like a win-win move for Amazon, which   should be looking for ways to open more physical locations in   addition to its Whole Foods Markets, its cashierless Amazon Go   Stores, and the places where it has delivery lockers.   IDC Retail Insights shows that retailers that take an   omnichannel (online and offline) approach   witness    a 15%-35% hike in their average transaction size, a 5% to 10%   jump in profitability from loyal customers, and 30% higher   customer lifetime value compared to single-channel retailers. Another study, also reported by   Shopify    , has found that companies employing a solid omnichannel retail   strategy enjoy an impressive 89% customer retention rate,   compared to just 33% for those who don't. A move into gas stations could also have far-reaching   consequences for Amazon in emerging markets like India, where   most of the population resides in rural areas.  The foreign picture  Amazon can boast of short shipping times in developed   countries such as the U.S. thanks to a solid delivery   infrastructure, but the same cannot be said about emerging   markets. Standard delivery times in India can sometimes go   up to 10 days, while delivery times aren't expected to   exceed five days in the U.S. Then there's the challenge of weak internet penetration. World   Bank data indicate that rural areas contain two-thirds of   the Indian population, but only 18% of the people in these areas   have access to the internet. That's why Amazon has been busy   recruiting mom-and-pop stores    in villages as agents who can spread awareness about online   commerce, take orders from the local population, and also make   deliveries. Now, just about every village in India has a gas station in   its vicinity, so it would make a lot of sense for Amazon to   deploy this concept in such a market. In this way Amazon could   catch the growing trend of online shopping in a key market where   41% of online shoppers live in small towns. In the end, the gas station concept could work wonders for   Amazon in both developed and emerging markets. So it wouldn't be   surprising to see the company actually testing it out.   10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

477,"January 20, 2019, 03:20:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,"Streaming Video Is Too Expensive for Walmart, but Not for Costco","
  Walmart    (NYSE: WMT) is reportedly abandoning its plans to launch a   streaming video service. Walmart had been in talks with media   executive Mark Greenberg since   last summer    , but the retailer wasn't comfortable with the large investment   it would need to make in streaming content, according to   CNBC    . Meanwhile,   Costco    (NASDAQ: COST) is still pursuing its own plans to launch a   streaming video service despite an increasing number of   competitors in the space including big media companies and   deep-pocketed tech giants. In   October    , I wrote ""With so many great options available already, [Walmart   and Costco will] have to come out the gate with a quality   product, which means spending a lot of money."" Here's why Costco   might be able to afford a big investment, while Walmart   can't.makeArticleAd();   Image source: Getty Images.   Costco sells subscriptions, Walmart's Vudu     doesn't  Costco uses a membership model to subsidize its low pricing.   In fact, practically all of Costco's profits come from membership   sales, not the actual goods it sells in its warehouses. And   Costco is really good at selling memberships. As of the end of   November, Costco had 52.2 million members and 95.4 million   cardholders. Meanwhile, Walmart has struggled to build memberships outside   of Sam's Club. It tried to offer an expedited shipping   subscription service, but it   failed    to catch on before Walmart decided to ditch it and offer free   2-day shipping to all of its online customers. Costco's streaming plans can be tied to its warehouse   membership, just as   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) ties Prime Video to its unlimited shipping   program. In particular, Costco could tie its streaming service to   its higher-tier Executive membership, which costs $120 per year.   Executive members have proven more loyal shoppers to Costco than   standard members, just as Prime members are more loyal Amazon   shoppers than non-members. Costco is lapping the impact of its last   membership fee increase    , and the impact will practically disappear by the end of its   fiscal year. It's done a good job growing its Executive   memberships, which total 19.7 million as of the end of last   quarter, but continuing to migrate customers from its standard   membership to the higher-tier will be what drives its profits   going forward. If Walmart were to compete in streaming, it would make sense   for it to follow the model put forth by Amazon and Costco, tying   it to its high-tier Sam's Club membership. The company has been   able to grow its Plus Sam's Club membership tier by offering   additional perks, including free shipping with no minimum   purchase for online orders. Sam's Club sales still only account   for about 12% of Walmart's overall revenue.  Walmart is focused on other things  While Walmart has billions in free cash flow coming in every   quarter, its investments are more focused on developing its core   business. It's spending heavily on   online grocery    pickup and delivery services, rapidly expanding its presence to   hundreds more stores every quarter. Walmart has even surpassed   Amazon in online grocery shopping by some measures as it expands   to areas Amazon doesn't serve. Grocery sales make up more than half of Walmart's revenue, so   it's much more important to the retailer's business than pursuing   an opportunity in streaming video. Walmart is also investing in its pricing in order to ensure it   stays competitive with Amazon and other retailers as more   shopping moves online. That has put pressure on its gross margin   in the U.S., which fell 28 basis points year over year last   quarter. Walmart stands to gain much more from focusing on its core   retail business than from expanding to a premium streaming video   service. It can still make smaller content investments with its   Vudu property and continue experimenting with ad-supported   streaming. There's no need for Walmart to dive into the deep end   with a streaming service, as it won't support its retail   operations. Costco's model, on the other hand, could drive higher   average membership rates, which would have a much bigger impact   on its bottom line.   10 stocks we like better than Walmart Inc.

478,"January 20, 2019, 12:00:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Stock Market Power Rankings: Microsoft Throws in the Mobile Towel,"
 Each week, I'm   ranking the biggest companies    that trade on U.S. exchanges based on their size (   market capitalization    ), momentum (total return over the past year), and recent news.   Before we get to the rankings, a quick word on a major   player.  Microsoft    (NASDAQ: MSFT)  has been a non-factor in mobile operating   systems, but this past week it wrote its own mobile-OS obituary.   The software behemoth is now recommending that anyone still   running Windows 10's mobile platform -- once known as Windows   Phone -- switch to   Apple    (NASDAQ: AAPL) or Android smartphones. Microsoft will no longer support Windows 10 mobile with free   security and other updates. Mr. Softy isn't going to bow out of   mobile entirely, though. It will continue to support its own apps   on iOS and Android. The problem is, running a platform is a   numbers game, and Microsoft-flavored smartphones just never   gained traction.makeArticleAd(); Microsoft is still getting the last laugh here, however. The   company's other software and hardware businesses are thriving,   and its market cap surpassed Apple's earlier this year. With that in mind, let's review this week's updated list of 50   top large-cap stocks, kicking things off with the top 10.   Image source: Getty Images.  This week's top 10 stocks  10. Walmart    (NYSE: WMT)  (new): $283.9 billion, down 6.3% over the past   year. The leading retail chain squeezes into the top 10 for the   first time. The chain of discount department stores and warehouse   clubs continues to resonate with consumers through low prices and   high turnover of merchandise. Walmart made waves earlier in the   week, when CNBC reported that it was abandoning plans to roll out   its own streaming service, but a   Variety    article followed later in the week denying the report.  9. Alibaba    (NYSE: BABA)  (up from 10): $407 billion market cap, down   14.8%. China's leading online marketplace is showing signs of life   after a rough second half of last year. Alibaba stock is up   nearly 15% in 2019. The past week kicked off with HSBC analyst   Binnie Wong boosting her price target from $177 to $190, but it   ended on a cautious note. Bloomberg reported that Alibaba is   paring back on expenses in response to the potentially slowing   economy. It's reportedly holding off on hiring and travel   spending.  8. Facebook    (NASDAQ: FB) :  (up from 9): $431.2 billion market cap, down   16.6%. The social-networking leader has paid the price for its data   privacy scandals. Usage growth has stalled, and the stock   continues to be the weakest performer over the past year among   the FANG components. Now it may have a   tangible    price to pay.   The Washington Post    is reporting that U.S. regulators have met to discuss a record   fine for Facebook for failing to protect the privacy of the   personal data of its users. Facebook's cash-rich balance sheet   will be able to easily hand down any financial penalty, but it   will make it that much harder to restore its reputation.  7. Pfizer    (NYSE: PFE) : $245.8 billion, up 15%. The pharmaceuticals giant kicked off the past trading week   with encouraging news. It received FDA acceptance of its new drug   application for tafamidis, a potential treatment   for transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy. Tafamidis may   treat a rare and under-diagnosed condition, and it remains the   only option that's cleared a late-phase clinical trial for its   efficacy, safety, and patient tolerability.  6. Visa    (NYSE: V) : $305.3 billion, up 12.5%. If investors have to choose between paper or plastic, the   better choice may be the latter. I'm talking not about the   environment but about swiping plastic instead of paying with   paper money, something that's becoming the more popular choice.   Visa is ""cashing"" in on the trend. It's the third most valuable   company to have posted a double-digit percentage gain over the   past year.  5. Berkshire Hathaway    (NYSE: BRK-A) : $503.4 billion, down 4.2%. Sometimes a week can make all the difference. A week ago we   were lamenting how Warren Buffett's classic company was sorely   underperforming the market in 2019. The stock was down 4% year to   date. A strong week with the shares moving higher in each of the   past four trading days now finds Berkshire Hathaway in positive   territory, and it's now trading nearly 2% higher in 2019. It was   a great week for financial-services stocks overall, with several   banking giants posting double-digit percentage gains, and Buffett   has historically kept an overweight position in financial   stocks.  4. Apple    : $741.7 billion, down 12.5%. The anecdotes of a rough holiday quarter at Apple have been   trickling in for weeks, and the fears were confirmed when the   tech titan itself warned that revenue declined for its fiscal   first quarter, which ended last month. The bad news keeps coming.   China's   Foxconn    -- Apple's assembler of choice of its iconic iPhone -- is   reportedly cutting 50,000 seasonal workers, suggesting that Apple   continues to scale back on its smartphone orders.  3. Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) : $766.9 billion, down 2.5%. It took the Bird Box Challenge to finally get Google's YouTube   to finally crack down on some of the dangerous behavior on its   site. The leading video-sharing site is now banning videos   featuring dangerous challenges and pranks. Of course, policy and   enforcing a policy are often entirely different things in the   wild world of Alphabet's popular subsidiary.  2. Microsoft    : $826.9 billion, up 19.5%. ""If you build it, they will come."" The old   Field of Dreams    mantra is apparently alive and well at Microsoft, as the software   giant announced that it plans to invest $500 million to build   affordable housing in Seattle. Pointing out that the Puget Sound   area has seen a 21% uptick in jobs since 2011 but only a 13%   increase in housing construction, Microsoft hopes that taking the   lead in funding affordable housing will help cool the real estate   market that's currently the country's sixth most expensive.   Whether this will make it easier for Microsoft to hire away   talent remains to be seen, but you can be sure that real estate   speculators who recently bought area properties looking to flip   them for a profit aren't going to be happy.  1. Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) : $829.4 billion, up 31.2%. Amazon turned heads a couple of years ago when it acquired   Whole Foods Market. The organic grocer was struggling at the   time, and it was starting to roll out 365, a concept offering   more affordably priced organic grocery items. Amazon has been   shaving down the generous markups at Whole Foods since taking   over, and that's apparently making 365 pretty irrelevant. Whole   Foods CEO John Mackey is telling employees it won't be opening   any new 365 locations, keeping the store count at just the dozen   existing stores. In short, Whole Foods Market   is    the new 365. The rank and file We'll get to No. 11 through No. 50 in a moment, but first,   let's look at one of the other Top 50 stocks making waves, for   better or worse.  Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX)  had all of the ups and downs of a serialized   drama on the streaming platform, leaving investors back on the   couch where they started by the end of the week. Shares moved   higher earlier in the week, when the company announced that it   will   increase the monthly rates    for its stateside subscribers by as much as 18%. Then it nearly   gave back all of those gains when it posted its fourth-quarter   results. Netflix fell short of its earlier revenue forecast, something   that may explain why Netflix chose to raise rates just ahead of   the report. Investors upset by the slowing top-line growth can   take comfort in knowing that Netflix will make more per   subscriber in the future. Netflix remains one of the market's hottest stocks over the   past year among large-cap stocks. There's no company commanding a   larger market cap than Netflix at nearly $150 billion with a   better return than the 53.9% gain it's delivered over the past 52   weeks. The stock may have essentially gone nowhere last week, but   that's certainly not indicative of where it will be in the   future. Stocks 11 through 50  11.

The company behind Citi and   other banking-related subsidiaries was one of only two stocks on   our list to deliver double-digit percentage gains. Citigroup   soared 11.3% for the week, moving higher every single trading   day. Bank of America was the other big winner, up 12.6%. Citigroup had been one of the larger companies not to make the   cut, held back by a rough trailing return.Things are still   problematic, given its 18.4% decline over the past year, but   momentum is on its side again. Citigroup replaces   Taiwan Semiconductor    (NYSE: TSM) . The Taiwanese maker of integrated circuits and   other semiconductor devices keeps dancing in and out of the   list. One to watch Let's talk about   American Express    (NYSE: AXP) . There's been better than average coverage of   financial stocks this week, but American Express is the only   credit card behemoth not on this list. It's smaller than Visa and   Mastercard    , with its $85.1 billion market cap. It's also been   underperforming its more valuable peers. The stock is up just   0.6% over the past year, a contrast to the double-digit   percentage trailing gains on Visa and Mastercard. American Express reported   fresh financial results    on Wednesday. Investors are concerned about slowing growth, as   investors spoiled by low double-digit growth in the amount AmEx   cardholders are spending are seeing that decelerate to 8%   currency-adjusted gains in its latest quarter. Most companies   would love to see that kind of growth, but on Wall Street it's   all about managing expectations. American Express is doing a good job of   refreshing its flagship charge cards    , beefing up the benefits while also increasing annual fees in   the process. The push began late last year and will continue   through early 2019. We'll see if its plastic truly lives up to   its iconic slogan of not leaving home without it.   10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (A     shares)       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

479,"January 20, 2019, 11:38:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,"Streaming Isn't Killing Theaters, Contrary to Popular Opinion","
 Over the past several years, the prevailing wisdom has been   that the advent of streaming would be the death knell for cinema.   It has been widely believed that over-the-top services like   Netflix    (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Prime Video by   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) were garnering more of consumers' limited free   time, which would ultimately be the straw that finally breaks the   back of movie houses. As it turns out, that logic is just plain wrong. Recent data   suggests that those who spend the most time watching streaming   video also spend the most time in theaters.   Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  Survey says... The National Association of Theater Owners (NATO) commissioned   a study by Ernst & Young's Quantitative Economics and   Statistics group. The purpose of the survey was to determine just   how many people were forgoing theaters to stay home and watch   streaming content. While the research was expected to reveal that   movie fans were spending more time on the couch, the results   showed quite the opposite: People who go to cinemas to watch   films also watch the most streaming content. The study, which included 2,500 U.S. residents, found that 80%   of those surveyed had been to a movie theater at least once   during the previous 12 months. Of that group, the majority those   who saw nine or more movies in a month also viewed eight or more   hours of streaming content each week. Conversely, those who only   saw one or two movies in the past year reported viewing seven   hours of streaming per week or less. Another surprising conclusion of the survey: Among the   respondents who didn't go to the theater at all in the previous   12 months, nearly half didn't stream any content, either. This   shows a very high correlation between movie attendance and   streaming behavior. A bitter rivalry There's been an ongoing and very public war of words between   theaters owners and Netflix. Back in 2013, NATO chief John   Fithian addressed Netflix's practice of releasing its films in   theaters and on its platform on the same day. ""Subscription movie   services and cheap rentals killed the DVD business, and now   [Netflix content chief Ted] Sarandos wants to kill the cinema as   well ... The only business that would be helped by day-and-date   release to Netflix is Netflix."" In 2014, the four largest theater chains in the U.S. --   AMC    (NYSE: AMC) , Regal, Carmike, and   Cinemark    (NYSE: CNK)  -- all declined to show   Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend    , Netflix's first original film, because of the company's   day-and-date release policy. AMC eventually relented,   allowing the movie to show on a few screens as a favor to partner   IMAX    (NYSE: IMAX) . The major multiplex chains similarly refused   to exhibit Netflix's   Beasts of No Nation    the following year. Netflix has had trouble internationally as well. Last year,   the folks at the Cannes Film Festival announced that Netflix and   other streaming services would be prohibited from submitting any   of their films for consideration unless they were first shown in   theaters. This followed a protest by French theater owners in   2017 after Netflix's original movies   Okja    and   The Meyerowitz Stories    were shown in the competition. French lawmakers had previously   passed a measure that banned movies from streaming services for   three years once they had been shown in theaters. This left   Netflix in an untenable situation, causing the company to boycott   Cannes.   Image source: Getty Images.  Amazon bypassed much of the controversy by releasing its   biggest movies in theaters and honoring the existing 90-day   window between theater debut and streaming release required by   theaters. It became the first streaming service to win at the   Academy Awards, taking home three statues for   Manchester by the Sea    in 2017. Will anything change? Netflix, with its 137 million subscribers worldwide, is more   interested in catering to them than theater chains. That said,   there are signs that the company is willing to adjust its   strategy given the right incentive. Netflix has long coveted   Oscar gold for its original movies. The company recently departed   from its long-standing practice of day-and-date releases by   showing several   high-profile movies in theaters    before they debuted on its streaming platform. Alfonso Cuaron's   Roma    , The Coen brothers'   The Ballad of Buster Scruggs    , the Andy Serkis-directed   Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle    , and the   Susanne Bier-helmed   Bird Box     all had limited theatrical engagements before being released to   Netflix subscribers. The findings of the survey and the company's willingness to   debut some films in theaters before they hit the streaming queue   may begin to thaw the chilly relationship between theaters and   Netflix. Even if it didn't, Netflix's allegiance is still to its   subscribers.   10 stocks we like better than Netflix       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

480,"January 20, 2019, 10:17:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,3 Stocks to Tap the Connected TV Boom,"
 It's no secret the television landscape it shifting. Streaming   video consumption is soaring according to data gathered by   measurement and intelligence platform Conviva: Streaming video   plays increased 52% year over year, and global viewing hours   jumped by 63%. Live streaming is also catching on, with live TV   content plays up 49% and viewing time up 54%, both year over   year. One of the biggest beneficiaries has been connected TVs. As   the move from linear TV to streaming gains steam, consumers are   increasingly relying on dedicated devices to deliver the best   experiences. The number of households with streaming players is   up 400% since 2014 according to Parks Associates. This movement has created a number of opportunities for   investors, with three stocks uniquely positioned to capture   gains. Let's see why   The Trade Desk    (NASDAQ: TTD) ,   Roku    (NASDAQ: ROKU) , and   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) have the best chances to capture the bulk of this   opportunity.makeArticleAd();   Connected TV's are seeing rapid adoption. Image source:     Getty Images.  The outlier The Trade Desk is winning in the connected TV market, but not   with a streaming device. The company specializes in programmatic   advertising, which automates the process of high-speed ad buying   in real time. This is one of the fastest growing areas of the   advertising market, and is expected to top $700 billion to close   out 2018. In the company's   most recent conference call    , The Trade Desk CEO Jeff Green called out connected TVs (CTV) as   one of the company's biggest opportunities. Ads on CTV grew   1,000% year over year in   the third quarter    , and more than doubled sequentially. That's impressive   growth considering the channel grew 21-fold in the second quarter   from year-earlier levels. Green cited rapid adoption by advertisers as fueling that   growth, and identified it as possibly ""the most important channel   for our company's growth in 2019 and beyond."" The CEO also added,   ""We've never seen an opportunity like CTV before and I don't   think we'll ever see one like it again. It is the biggest   opportunity we've ever seen and probably ever will."" Connected TVs comprise only one area fueling The Trade Desks   growth. Revenue grew 54% year over year during the first nine   months of 2018, which is even more impressive considering the   tough comps the company faced from the prior year. Revenue   increased by 52% in 2017, and 78% in 2016, both year over   year. This illustrates why The Trade Desk is in a unique   position to take advantage of this generational shift. The pure play If there's anything close to a pure play in connected TVs, it   would have to be Roku. The company is tapping both segments of   the market -- devices and advertising. Roku pioneered the   streaming internet player in collaboration with Netflix more than   a decade ago, and has been a leading provider of streaming   devices ever since. It added connected TVs to the mix in early   2014. Roku's platform revenue, which comes from advertising, hit   $100 million for the first time in   the third quarter    , up 74% year over year, and now eclipses revenue from the sale   of its devices, which grew 9% to $73 million.   Premium subscriptions are coming to The Roku Channel. Image     source: Roku.  The addition of The Roku Channel in late 2017 catapulted the   company forward, and Roku recently announced   the addition of premium channels    to its platform. The company also released the preliminary   results of its holiday quarter, providing two key metrics for   investors. Active accounts grew to an estimated 27 million, up   40% year over year, while streaming hours climbed to 7.3 billion,   an increase of 68%. This shows that Roku's strategy is still   bearing fruit. The elephant in the room Amazon has established itself as a significant force in a   number of industries, and that growing list includes not only   streaming video but also the products that make it happen.   Amazon's line of Fire TV devices are well known, but new data   shows the platform may be much more pervasive than previously   believed. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week,   Amazon revealed that it had ""well over"" 30 million active users   for its video streaming devices. That's up 20% from the 25   million the company cited back in October -- and Amazon expects   that growth to accelerate in the coming months. ""We're still in   the middle of the 'buy' to 'turn on' period"" from the holiday   shopping season according to Marc Whitten, Amazon's head of Fire   TV. This gives Amazon a market ripe for its advertising, an area   where growth has soared, producing triple-digit gains in each of   the past three quarters. Advertising is among Amazon's fastest   growing segments, and is expected to   top $10 billion    to close out 2018. Investors can rest easy knowing that there's more to Amazon   than just e-commerce.

MUNICH, Jan 20 (Reuters) - ProSiebenSat.1 Media  believes that price increases by U.S. streaming giant Netflix  could ease competitive pressures on the German group's core TV business and is bullish on growth at its e-commerce arm, CEO Max Conze said.
Conze took the helm at the Munich-based broadcaster last June but has had a rough welcome from investors who have sent its shares to seven-year lows on doubts that he can revive its ailing free-to-air TV business.
The former CEO of UK appliances company Dyson told Reuters that plans to relaunch a German streaming venture in cooperation with Discovery Inc, public broadcaster ZDF, publisher Axel Springer  and possibly others were on track for late summer.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
Asked about the recent price increase by Netflix, as well as the cash burn reported in its latest results, Conze expressed hope that the U.S. streaming giants would move towards a model that seeks to target profit as well as growth. 
""Part of the challenge has, of course, been that the streaming direct-to-consumer models - both Netflix and Amazon - are fundamentally subsidised. They are not really money-making models,"" said Conze.
""They are great for you and me as consumers, but hard to compete against. If these companies get a little bit more focused in the future on how to turn this into a profitable business model, that actually creates an environment that makes it somewhat easier for us to compete.""
Speaking on the sidelines of the DLD Munich technology  conference on Sunday, Conze also forecast that ProSieben's e-commerce arm NuCom would this year achieve revenue growth, including acquisitions, in excess of 20 percent.
""That business is developing, growing rapidly and very synergistic with entertainment,"" he said.
NuCom's match-making property Parship Elite bought U.S. dating site eharmony late last year and recently secured direct control over home services company Aroundhome. 
The e-commerce unit, which owns 10 properties, has ""another couple of things that are cooking"", said Conze, declining to elaborate.

 Right now, when I say, ""Alexa, mow the lawn,"" my   Amazon     smart speaker says, ""I added 'mow the lawn' to your   shopping list."" So there are some things technology can't   do...yet. But if you happen to have a new Wi-Fi enabled Roomba vacuum   cleaner by   iRobot    (NASDAQ: IRBT) , as well as an Amazon Echo -- and you've set it   all up properly -- you can say, ""Alexa, ask Roomba to start   cleaning,"" and check vacuuming off your list of chores. And with   an iRobot robotic lawn mower on the horizon, Alexa just might be   able to mow my lawn soon. This all sounds amazing, but it may not be enough to earn   iRobot a spot in your portfolio. Let's dig a little bit deeper to   see if the robotic vacuum pioneer is a worthwhile investment.makeArticleAd();   Besides being a great cat toy, iRobot's best-selling robotic     vacuums can integrate into smart-home systems. Image source:     Getty Images.  Not like the others iRobot is a small company that's making a big impact, but its   balance sheet doesn't look like that of many tech   start-ups. For one thing, there's no long-term debt. None.   Since 2015, the company has been able to finance its growth and   its extensive research and development efforts almost exclusively   from its profits, while reducing its overall share count by   6%. The company's income statement also doesn't look like most   manufacturers', considering its gross profit margin on a   trailing-12-month basis is 50.5%. That's incredibly high for a   manufacturer. Manufacturing companies often see profits eaten up   by production costs.   Whirlpool    's gross margin, for example, is just 17%, while Hoover and Dirt   Devil parent company   Techtronic    's is 37%. While many consumer appliance makers have struggled over the   past year -- Whirlpool's stock, for example, is down 28.2% --   iRobot's is down only 4.3%, outperforming the   S&P 500    . That's thanks to some   stellar performance     that's led revenue and net income to move steadily higher   throughout the year. The longer-term picture is even brighter:   Over the past five years, iRobot has increased revenue and net   income by 108.9% and 174.5%, respectively. But the company's   biggest opportunities may lie ahead. The home of the future We're not quite living in an episode of   The Jetsons    , but there's no denying that the market for smart-home devices   is not only growing quickly, but seeing rapid technological   advances. According to eMarketer, domestic smart speaker usage is   set to increase 15% year over year in 2019, partially as a result   of their popularity as a Christmas gift item. That means about   74.2 million people -- roughly 27% of the U.S. population -- will   have a smart speaker in their home. That's a lot, considering these devices didn't even exist a   few years ago. But it's still a small enough number that there's   plenty of room for the market to grow. In fact, research firm   Strategy Analytics predicts that 1.94 billion smart-home devices   will be sold in 2023, outpacing demand for smartphones. The   Market Research Store estimates a total smart-home market of $163   billion by 2026. Of course, people with smart-home speakers aren't just going   to use them to play music. They'll want to use them to vacuum and   mop the floors, clean the pool, and mow the lawn. iRobot already   offers robots that can do three of those four chores. As for the   lawn mower, on the   most recent earnings call    , CEO Colin Angle would only say, ""We remain committed to   launching a lawnmower and I'll stop there. It's a...well, I'll   stop there."" iRobot has been developing (and patenting) the room-mapping   technology that will allow its devices to more effectively   accomplish their tasks. For example, the newest v7 Roomba can   distinguish rooms from one another, allowing you to command it to   clean a specific room. But this technology can be used in other   ways. In fact, Angle says he's working with   Alphabet    's Google to develop ""new, innovative smart-home experiences that   leverage a broader understanding of the home's space, enabled   through Roomba's spatial awareness of the home."" iRobot has been   partnering with Amazon as well. Scratching the surface With all of this potential in the world of smart-home systems,   it's easy to forget that iRobot also has a lot of opportunity   within the overall vacuum market. It's the undisputed leader in   robotic vacuums, with an impressive 62% of       global market    share, but robotic vacuums make up a small piece of the overall   vacuum market. Obviously, a robotic vacuum costs more than many traditional   vacuums, but even in the world of high-end vacuums -- those that   cost $200 or more -- robotic vacuums   occupy a small niche    . Specifically, of the $7.5 billion spent on high-end vacuums in   2017, robotic vacuums only accounted for about $1.7 billion   (roughly 23%). That market is highly concentrated in the U.S., which is why   iRobot is aggressively targeting the European and Japanese   markets, with some success. In Q3 2018, revenue grew by 19% in   its Europe, Middle East, and Africa region and by 13% in   Japan. Of course, that was dwarfed by the 45% revenue growth in   the U.S., but it shows that iRobot is making inroads in these   crucial global markets. International growth will also help to   offset the potential impact of higher U.S. tariffs on vacuum   cleaners that went into effect this year.      With all of this growth opportunity, it's surprising that   iRobot's P/E ratio of 36 is actually lower than Whirlpool's 37.   But it is a lot higher than, say, Techtronic's 18.4. Its   Enterprise Value to EBITDA ratio of 15.9, on the other hand, is   more in line with Whirlpool's 16.6 and Techtronic's 12.9. Both   those metrics, though, are lower than they were two years ago,   and definitely on the low end of their range over the past two   years, thanks in large part to the big market sell-off in October   2018. Investor takeaway iRobot's current business of selling robotic vacuums is strong   and growing, and it has propelled the company to the top spot in   its industry with no debt on the balance sheet. Not only is the   untapped market for robotic vacuums huge, but iRobot is also   well-positioned to take advantage of the current trend toward the   smart home. For most stocks, a   PE ratio    of 35 is a rather high valuation. For iRobot, though, this is low   compared to the typical premium assigned to this high-growth   stock. At its current valuation, iRobot definitely looks like a   buy.   10 stocks we like better than iRobot       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

 One of the best things about   bear markets    is that they often give investors the opportunity to pick up   shares in great companies at prices that would otherwise not be   available. Thanks to the market's December swoon, we have such an   opportunity today. Two of the most dominant businesses in the public markets are   now trading for about 20% less than they were just a few weeks   ago. Read on to learn more about them -- and how you can use this   situation to your advantage.   Bear markets bring about buying opportunities for the bulls.     Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  The e-commerce juggernaut Few businesses give investors more ways to win than   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) . The tech titan   dominates online retail    in the U.S. and, increasingly, many other areas of the world. Yet   despite years of torrid growth, e-commerce still represents only   about 10% of total retail sales in the U.S. Moreover,   billions of people around the globe have yet to even gain access   to the internet. In turn, Amazon's online retail operations have   long runways for growth still ahead. Incredibly, the company has built another business that could   have even more long-term profit potential than its e-commerce   platform: Amazon Web Services. AWS is the leading cloud computing   infrastructure platform in the world, with an approximately 50%   share of this rapidly growing market. With the overall cloud   services market projected to exceed $278 billion by 2021,   according to IT research company   Gartner    , AWS should continue to fuel Amazon's growth for many years to   come. The success of its e-commerce and cloud businesses has allowed   Amazon to expand into other high-growth markets. It's built a   booming   advertising business    and a leading position in the quickly expanding   smart-device market    . Additionally, the company's   acquisition of Whole Foods    has made it a force to be reckoned with in the $640 billion U.S.   grocery industry. Better still, the   recent market decline    has taken Amazon's shares down along with it. Now off about 20%   from its 52-week high, Amazon's stock is currently trading   for around 60 times Wall Street's earnings estimates for   2019. Though seemingly expensive at first blush, that's a   quite reasonable price to pay for an elite business that's   forecast to grow its profits at more than 42% annually during the   next half-decade. Investors may want to use the stock's   recent sell-off as an opportunity to acquire an ownership stake   in this amazing long-term growth story. The search king We live in the age of information -- and Google is where much   of the world goes to find the knowledge they seek. But new   investors might need to do an internet search of their own to   figure out    how   to invest    in Google, because the tech giant   reorganized its corporate structure    in 2015 to better reflect its broad collection of businesses,   adopting the name   Alphabet    (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) for the parent company that owns   Google as well as other corporate entities. Each query conducted on Google's ubiquitous websites and   mobile apps feeds more data into its powerful search engine. This   data helps Google better target its ads, which makes them more   relevant to users and valuable to marketers. As Google collects   more data, it generates more cash, which it can then use to   improve its services, which go on to collect more data, and so   on. It's a virtuous cycle that has helped the company build one   of the most powerful   economic moats    ever created. Yet Google's ecosystem extends well beyond search. More than 2   billion people use its Android mobile operating system, making it   the most dominant mobile platform by far. Nearly 2 billion   users watch over 1 billion hours of videos on YouTube every   day. In addition, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play Store,   Chrome, and Google Drive all serve more than 1 billion users   each. The tech titan is also investing aggressively in areas such as   self-driving vehicles    ,   healthcare    ,   cloud computing    , and   cybersecurity    . The incredible profitability of Alphabet's search business   allows it to reinvest some of its bountiful cash flow into   ""moonshots"" -- risky but potentially high-reward endeavors that   can disrupt massive industries and even create entirely new ones.   In this way, an investment in Alphabet comes with the additional   upside of a venture capital-like tech fund -- one that's managed   by some of the best minds in the industry with a proven track   record of value-creation. Better still, Alphabet's stock is currently almost 20% off   from its highs of the past year. Shares can now be had for   about 22 times analysts' forward earnings estimates for   2019 -- a fair price to pay for a dominant business that's   projected to grow its earnings by more than 15% annually over the   five years. As such, investors may want to consider buying   some of the search king's sock today.   10 stocks we like better than Alphabet (A     shares)       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

484,"January 19, 2019, 04:40:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,Microsoft Tethers Another Major Retailer to Its Cloud,"
  Microsoft    (NASDAQ: MSFT) recently signed a seven-year cloud deal with   Walgreens Boots Alliance    (NASDAQ: WBA) that tethers over 380,000 Walgreens employees   to its Office 365 apps. Walgreens will also use Microsoft's Azure   as its preferred cloud provider for its IT infrastructure.   Furthermore, the two companies will co-develop digital health   platforms powered by Azure and Microsoft's AI technologies, and   pilot 12 in-store ""digital health corners"" for sales of   healthcare-related devices. This broad partnership could help both companies counter   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) , which competes against Microsoft in the cloud   platform market with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Walgreens in   the online pharmacy market with its takeover of PillPack.   However, the deal might benefit Microsoft more than Walgreens,   which still faces a tough uphill battle as Amazon ramps up its   sales of drugs and other healthcare products online.   Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();  Another piece of Microsoft's cloud strategy Microsoft generates more annual cloud revenues than   Amazon, but most of that revenue comes from cloud software   services like Office 365 and Dynamics CRM. Azure accounts for a   growing percentage of that business, but it still generates less   revenue than AWS. However, Azure is growing at a faster rate than AWS. In their   latest quarters,    Microsoft   report    ed that Azure's revenue rose 76% year-over-year, while   Amazon's AWS revenue climbed 46%. These cloud platforms are core pillars of growth for both   companies. Microsoft relies on the growth of Azure and its cloud   services to lock in enterprise customers and reduce its   dependence on Windows OS licenses. Amazon uses the growth of   AWS's higher-margin business to offset the lower margins of its   online marketplaces, which enables it to expand its Prime   ecosystem with loss-leading strategies. Amazon has a first mover advantage in the cloud platform   market, but Microsoft is leveraging its dominance of PC operating   systems and enterprise productivity software to tether more   customers to Azure. Microsoft also enjoys a unique advantage with brick-and-mortar   retailers. Retailers like Walgreens, which are threatened by   Amazon, are less likely to use AWS because it supports the growth   of Amazon's online marketplaces. Therefore, Azure is becoming an   attractive cloud provider for retailers that   don't want to help    Amazon -- and that growing list already includes   Walmart    (NYSE: WMT) ,   Kroger    (NYSE: KR) , and   Gap    .   Image source: Getty Images.  Expanding into the smart retail and healthcare markets Microsoft's partnership with Walgreens should boost its   commercial cloud revenues, which rose 47% annually to $8.5   billion last quarter. Its in-store digital health corners could   also complement its efforts to gather more data from customers   for analytics purposes. We already saw Microsoft implement similar systems for Walmart   and Kroger. Walmart is using Microsoft's cloud-based tools   to manage    its supply chain, monitor energy consumption levels, and control   Internet of Things (IoT) devices in its warehouses and stores.   Microsoft is also reportedly helping Walmart develop cashierless   stores to challenge Amazon Go. Kroger is linking its   digital shelves    to Azure, which can gather data and change prices based on   real-time demand.

485,"January 19, 2019, 04:07:00 PM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,"Amazon's Rumored Streaming Video Game Service Holds Potential, but Faces Hurdles","
 A report   published    recently in The Information said that   Amazon    (NASDAQ: AMZN) is working on cloud-based video game streaming   service that would allow users to play top-notch video games   (think the blockbusters that people buy new consoles just to   play)   without    the need for high-end video game consoles. Instead, users would   pay a monthly subscription fee and be able to play those games on   nearly any device or screen they own. This could potentially catalyze a big change in an industry   that's still dominated by physical video game disks and consoles.   And for Amazon, the move would represent yet another large step   toward selling more services to customers.   Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();   Why a video game service could be big for     Amazon  A video game streaming service represents an opportunity for   Amazon to combine its   cloud computing prowess    with the growing video game industry. Globally, video game   industry sales are expected to rise from $137.9 billion last year   to more than $180 billion in 2021, according to market research   company Newzoo. That's a significant market that Amazon is only nominally   involved with right now. The company   bought Twitch    , a platform that allows users to view video game livestreams,   back in 2014 for $970 million. But this rumored offering would   take Amazon's video game interest to an entirely new level,   allowing the company to benefit from the ongoing shift from   console gaming to mobile games. Last year, mobile games accounted   for 51% of all video game sales, and by 2021, they're forecast to   make up 59%. The highest quality video games have intense video processing   demands that require high-end graphics processors, so any   streaming service would require a heavy-duty cloud computing   solution. But Amazon's Web Services (AWS) would easily be up to   the task. It currently holds the largest slice of the public   cloud computing market -- AWS's approximately 34% share puts it   far ahead of its nearest rival,   Microsoft    (NASDAQ: MSFT) , which has just a 14% share.  This isn't a slam dunk yet  The shift from a video game business that is dominated by   consoles with physical disks spinning inside of them to one   that's led by cloud-based gaming services is already overdue.   Hardware agnostic streaming subscriptions now deliver a large   segment of our movies, television shows, and music -- it's   time for the same transition to happen to video games. But Amazon won't have this market all to itself when its   service launches.   Alphabet    's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google is reportedly working on   its own   video game streaming platform    , and Microsoft is already promoting its own upcoming service,   called   xCloud    . Microsoft says xCloud will allow users to play games on   consoles, PCs, and mobile devices; the company will begin public   trials of the service this year. Microsoft has a clear advantage over Amazon in the gaming   space, considering that it sells one of the most popular gaming   consoles on the market. Additionally, Microsoft would have a   better understanding of how to get games working across varying   devices because of its experience with PCs, smartphones, and   software. All of this means that while Amazon could certainly benefit   from a new video game streaming service, this market won't be a   slam dunk for it to dominate. Investors should be cautiously   optimistic about such a service, but understand that when, and   if, it launches, Amazon will be entering a market where Microsoft   and others have held sway for years -- and they're not likely to   let a newcomer steal away their video game crowns any time   soon.   10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

PARIS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A European Union-wide tax on the world's top digital companies could be reached by the end of March, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in an interview published on Sunday.
""We made a compromise offer to Germany in December and I am convinced that a deal is within arm's reach between now and the end of March. With the European elections just a few months away, our citizens would find it incomprehensible if we gave up on this,"" Le Maire told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper.
In December, European Union finance ministers failed to agree a tax on digital revenues, despite a last minute Franco-German plan to salvage the proposal by narrowing its focus to companies such as Google  and Facebook. makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');

 E-commerce in India is expected to be a $100 billion market   opportunity by 2022, which PwC says makes it ""arguably the   world's most promising internet economy."" It is the   second-biggest economy in Asia and the world's second-biggest   internet market, and it is growing rapidly. But India's government may have just stepped on the brakes by   limiting how much   Amazon.com    (NASDAQ: AMZN) and   Walmart    (NYSE: WMT) will be able to control the market. It imposed new   rules that take effect Feb. 1 and primarily do three things:  Prohibit e-commerce retailers from selling products from     businesses they have an equity investment in. Prohibit exclusive arrangements with those businesses. Limit discounts and cash-back programs.  Though the rules apply to everyone, it's clear India is   targeting Amazon and Walmart, which have a combined market share   in excess of 70%. Both have   invested heavily in India    -- Amazon has invested some $7 billion, while Walmart paid   $16 billion for a majority stake in Flipkart -- and the   government's crackdown will limit how they operate.makeArticleAd(); Worse, it could inhibit the ability of consumers to enjoy the   low prices and broad range of products most associate with the   two retailers, and may deter other e-commerce companies from   making investments in India.   Image source: Getty Images.  More controls India's foreign direct-investment laws   already limited     how outside companies could function in the country. For   example, Walmart already was prohibited from selling products on   Flipkart that were sourced outside of India. The new rules   further clarify just what is allowed, and essentially tell the   platforms they must act like marketplaces, not retailers. Businesses that own the inventory being sold on the   controlling e-commerce platform will no longer be able to do so   if the platform owns 25% or more of those businesses. Flipkart,   which is 77% owned by Walmart, used to derive most of its sales   from its subsidiary WS Retail. But apparently in anticipation of   the new rules, it largely stopped selling its products on the   platform. Amazon, though, derives around 40% of its Amazon India sales   from Cloudtail India, its joint deal with Catamaran Ventures. It   has another major retailer, Appario Retail, that also exceeds the   25% threshold. Under the new rules, they won't be able to sell on   Amazon. A bland state of sameness? Brands will also be prohibited from teaming up with platforms   to offer exclusive discounts, which may just wreck the smartphone   market in India. Both Flipkart and Amazon rely upon exclusive   arrangements with smartphone makers during product launches, such   as   Xiaomi    launching new models of its Mi phones on Amazon and rival Chinese   smartphone maker Oppo doing so on Flipkart. There were nearly 70 exclusive smartphone offers on Flipkart   in 2018 and almost 50 on Amazon. Smartphones account for half of   all e-commerce sales in India, and the ability to launch new   products exclusively on one site or the other could impede future   sales. The rest of the online retail market could implode from the   rule prohibiting deep discounting. Amazon and Flipkart can no   longer influence, either directly or indirectly, the offer of   discounts on products and, the government says, ""shall maintain a   level playing field."" With little ability to differentiate   themselves, online retailers could find their sales   stagnating. The key takeaway The new rules were ostensibly implemented to help small   retailers remain competitive against the industry giants and   their alleged ""predatory"" pricing policies. But giving consumers   the absolute lowest prices and widest selection of goods was what   helped elevate India's e-commerce market to the pinnacle at which   it sits. In light of these new regulations, those grandiose estimates   of market growth may have to be scaled back, and those   multibillion-dollar investments Amazon and Walmart made in India   may end up being written down some as the full impact plays out   and both retailers adjust to the new rules of the game.   10 stocks we like better than Amazon       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

496,"January 18, 2019, 09:15:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Motley Fool,3 Stocks That Have Doubled and Still Have Room to Grow,"
 ""Buy low, sell high"" is one of the most quoted truisms in the   investing world, but sometimes investors will actually be best   served by buying a stock that's priced relatively high on its   path to climbing even higher. If a company is delivering strong   sales and earnings performance and powering impressive share   price gains, a stock can still be a steal even if it has doubled   in relatively short order. In many cases, businesses that are   winning tend to keep winning. With that in mind, we asked three Motley Fool contributors to   profile a company that has posted impressive gains and still has   big potential. Read on to see why they identified   Etsy    (NASDAQ: ETSY) ,   iRobot    (NASDAQ: IRBT) , and   Baozun    (NASDAQ: BZUN) as promising growth stocks that still have room to   run.   Image source: Getty Images.makeArticleAd();   Eenie, meenie, minie...Etsy    Rich Smith    (Etsy):    I have to admit that I'm a bit conflicted about today's choice   for a stock that's ""doubled and still has room to grow."" On the   one hand, Etsy is clearly   not    a cheap stock. With just $81 million in trailing earnings but a   market capitalization well in excess of $6.3   billion    , Etsy shares sell for the princely sum of 78.5 times trailing   earnings. On the other hand, though, if Etsy has grown its share   price more than 100% (and it has; it's actually up   160    % over the past year), is even 78.5 times earnings too much to   pay? Maybe not -- if Etsy can   keep up the growth    . And here's where I find myself starting to tilt in Etsy's   favor. Over the last 12 months, Etsy only did about $540 million   in total sales. That's the merest fraction of   eBay    's $10.2 billion revenue haul, not even to mention the gazillions   of dollars   Amazon    brings in. As Etsy's market expands, and in particular as the   company connects more of the ""rest of the world's"" creators   (currently just 28% of Etsy's total revenues) with the rich   consumer markets of the United States, the United Kingdom, and   Germany (the other 72%), I think Etsy's revenue stream will only   swell larger. Analysts seem to agree. According to data from      S&P Global Market Intelligence    , they're looking for Etsy to earn $0.50 per share this year,   then more than double that by 2020, then double it   again    by 2022. This, it seems to me, leaves plenty of room for Etsy to grow   and grow and then grow some more. Cleaning up over the holidays   Demitri Kalogeropoulos    (iRobot):    Shares of robotic cleaning device specialist iRobot were up by   nearly 300% since early 2016, but the stock ended that three-year   period higher by ""just"" 175%. Market volatility and Wall Street   worries over new competition and rising costs contributed to a   December slump for the stock. Investors are giving those concerns   too much weight. After all, iRobot's sales and margins were supposed to be hurt   by the flood of new competition into the industry last year.   Instead, revenue growth accelerated to a 29% spike in the latest   quarter as consumers showed an overwhelming preference for the   industry leader's Roomba devices over cheaper rivals.   Profitability   held up fine    , too, with average selling prices rising to $289 through the   last nine months from $260 in the year-ago period. iRobo   t report    s holiday-quarter results in early February, and that   announcement will help investors gauge whether demand is still   robust for its autonomous vacuuming products and new mopping   devices. That report will also include an update on costs, which   executives warned could spike over the short term due to new   tariffs on some of its manufacturing materials. But while rising   expenses might dampen profit growth in 2019, iRobot's long-term   outlook is bright -- assuming it can maintain its leading market   share position as the industry   expands over the next decade    . An e-commerce player at 50% off    Keith Noonan      (Baozun):     A person could be forgiven for thinking that Baozun's business   had hit big snags and that its stock was on an irreversible slide   if they only looked at the company's share-price trajectory over   the last year. The Chinese e-commerce stock has lost roughly half   of its value over the last six months, and concerns about trade   tensions and economic slowdown continue to weigh on   performance. Baozun stock traded as high as $67 per share last summer, but   shares are trading near $30 today and have struggled to break   above that range. However, zoom the chart out and take a look at   the broader trajectory of the company's business, and there's a   different story to observe. The company's stock has climbed by   more than 340% over the last three years, and there are   compelling reasons to think that it could bounce back from its   recent slide and deliver more strong performance for   shareholders. Baozun still has a long runway for growth. China already   stands as the world's largest e-commerce market, and even if its   growth rate has been slowing recently, it's still expanding at a   rapid clip that creates a favorable operating backdrop. Baozun   provides Western brands with   customizable online retail websites    and featured sales portals on the country's biggest e-commerce   outlets, making it easy for its partners to ramp up their retail   presence in the Middle Kingdom. Because of this, the company   stands out as an appealing way to benefit from the growth of   Western brands in China as well as the company's booming   e-commerce market. Shares trade at roughly 20 times this year's expected earnings   after the big stock slide. Investors should proceed with the   understanding that the stock is prone to volatility, but that's a   valuation that could present an attractive entry point for   long-term investors.   10 stocks we like better than iRobot       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen.

497,"January 18, 2019, 09:09:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Is Diversification Apple's Answer to iPhone's China Struggle?,"
 Apple's AAPL  struggle with falling iPhone demand and poor price performance has compelled it to diversify the services businesses at a fast pace, in a bid to ride out the alarming drop in China's iPhone sales. Apple has been forming an array of partnerships with its competitors in its service businesses segment such as video streaming and making its services available on other platforms to generate revenue growth apart from its commission-driven services business operations. This new approach to diversify the company's operations in order to eliminate risks indicates Apple's changing mindset about expanding its reach beyond the iPhone.  Sluggish iPhone Sales Threaten Apple Revenues  China's weak economy has been instrumental in pulling back iPhone sales throughout last year, largely owing to the ongoing trade war with the United States. Declining popularity of iPhone among Chinese consumers, who feels that iPhone, seeks a higher price than it's worth and now have homegrown brands such as Xiaomi and Huawei to choose from also played a part. China is a competitive market for smartphones by virtue of its population and accounts for nearly a third of the iPhone's total sales worldwide. Thus, the importance of an affirmative stand in the Chinese market cannot be understated for the iPhone maker. Although iPhone was exempted from U.S.-China trade tariffs, poor pricing strategy and lack of innovation on its part has made Apple lag Samsung and Huawei in the global smartphone market. Fourth-quarter iPhone shipments to China witnessed a 20% decline from the year-ago period as sales are expected to decline 4.8-5.5% in 2019 against decrease of 2.9-3.3% in 2018, reflecting iPhone's poor demand in the Asian nation. This makes it prudent for Apple to dip its toes in other revenue-generating spaces rather than depend on iPhone sales alone.  Quality Services to Dominate New Partnerships  According to a Forbes report, services businesses have been Apple's major growth driver, expanding about 20% over the past few years. Commissions from third parties, licensing, for app sales etc., generate about two-thirds of the services revenues. Apple's first key partnership was with Amazon AMZN  in November, when Apple Music was made available on Echo devices. This allowed users to control streaming using Alexa, a competitor to Apple's Siri. A few months before this partnership, Apple had tried to take on Echo with its HomePod speaker, but failed to establish itself in a way it could compete with Alexa. Earlier this month, Apple announced a partnership with one of its fiercest competitors Samsung SSNLF  , which makes available iTunes movie and TV content on Samsung smart TVs. In addition, iPad and iPhone users can send content from their screens to Samsung smart TVs using AirPlay 2. Although the two companies have been rivals in the smartphone space for years, Apple receives many of its key components such as hardware for its gadgets. Apple formed a partnership with Verizon VZ  this week to offer free Apple Music with selected premium data plans of the latter. Apple's willingness to make its content available on other platforms is indicative of its understanding of the vast consumer base that doesn't own an Apple device and thus isn't able to access Apple content. Apple is also going to unveil a TV service toward the end of this year that offers both free and paid content. Apple's bid for diversification could ultimately provide a significant boost to the company's growth and revenues if it can generate quality content that can compete with industry rivals such as Netflix NFLX  , Amazon and Hulu in the video streaming space. Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Apple and Verizon carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   .

498,"January 18, 2019, 09:03:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Can Analog Strength Aid Texas Instruments (TXN) Q4 Earnings?,"
  Texas Instruments TXN  or TI is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2018 results on Jan 23, after market close. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with average positive surprise of 3.07%. We expect Texas Instruments to perform well in the to-be-reported quarter, on the back of strength in several higher-margin and high-growth market areas. Also, it is gradually expanding exposure in industrial and automotive markets, which should benefit the upcoming results. We observe that shares of Texas Instruments have lost 16.2% over the past 12 months compared with its industry  's decline of 12.1%.     Expectations From Analog  TI's analog business has been recording both sequential and year-over-year growth over the last four quarters, driven by strong performance in almost all its product lines. In the las t report  ed quarter, this segment generated revenues of $2.9 billion, up 8% from the year-ago quarter. We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, given TI's compelling product line and manufacturing efficiencies that include growing 300-millimeter Analog output. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analog segment revenues is currently pegged at $2.6 billion.  Expectations From Embedded Processing  In the third quarter, it generated $894 million revenues, down 4% year over year. This was primarily owing to weak performance of processors during the quarter. Further, sluggishness in the communications equipment market remained negative throughout the quarter, without which the revenues within this segment would have reflected growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Embedded Processing revenues is currently pegged at $839 million.  Overall Picture  TI has always been a well-executed company. Management remains focused on increasing its free cash flow per share and strengthening competitive advantages. However, increasing competition in the auto and industrial space, along with unfavorable currency impact may hurt its results.  What Our Model Says  According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP  . Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. Currently, Texas Instruments has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, making surprise prediction difficult.

  Waters Corporation WAT  is set to report fourth-quarter 2018 results on Jan 23.  makeArticleAd();  The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering average positive earnings surprise of 2.02%.    In the las t report  ed quarter, Waters' earnings of $1.92 per share recorded a positive surprise of 1.05% and surged 8.5% on a year-over-year basis. However, the figure declined 1.5% sequentially.    Net sales also decreased 3.1% sequentially but improved 2.2% year over year to $578.02 million. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $588.1 million.    Robust end-market results especially in the Governmental & Academic market drove year-over-year top-line growth. Further, it was aided by the company's strong momentum across Asia.    For the fourth quarter, Waters expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of $2.55-$2.65 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.65 per share.    Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.   Segmental Performance to Aid Growth    Waters is riding on its robust product portfolio in the analytical instruments space. This is likely to benefit the company's fourth-quarter results.    Notably, the company's product are categorized into two segments-Waters and TA.The segments areexpected to continue aiding its end-market performance.    For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in Waters segment is pegged at $615 million, up 2.1% year over year when compared with actuals. Well-performing chromatography instruments are anticipatedto drive sales within this segmentbacked bysolid momentum across product pipelines such as Acuity Arc Bio and Acuity Plus. Further, launch of the company's advanced screening system namely RenataDX is a major positive.    Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in TA segmentis pegged at $87 million, up 2.6% on a year-over-year basis. The company's innovative thermal analyzers and strengthening orders are expected to continue aiding growth in this segment.   Waters Corporation Price and EPS Surprise        Waters Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    |      Waters Corporation Quote    End-Market Momentum  End-market performance remains one of the key growth factor for Waters.    Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in Pharmaceutical, Industrial and Governmental & Academic (G&A) end-markets is pegged at $382 million, $224 million and $100 million, respectively.    When compared with the actuals, sales in Pharmaceutical are up 2.3% year over year. The company is gaining traction in the U.S. pharma market. Improving spending by large pharma customers in the United States is likely to bolster Waters' performance in this end-market in the quarter under review.    Further, sales in the industrial market are up 3.3% from the prior-year quarter. Growing opportunities across the environmental applications, food, safety and material characterization spaces continue to boost demand for the company's robust product pipelines. This is anticipated to aid Waters' sales in this market.    G&A market in which Waters' performance is improving and contributes significantly to its top-line growth remains a major tailwind. Sales in this market are up 3% year over year compared with last year's actual figure.    We believe all the above-mentioned growth factors are anticipated to drive the company's result in the to-be-reported quarter.   What Our Model Says    According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

  Lam Research Corporation LRCX  is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jan 23. In the las t report  ed quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.67%. Lam Research's surprise history has been pretty impressive. The company surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 9.70%. Shares of Lam Research have lost 31% in the past year compared with its industry  's decline of 28.5%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.  Factors to Consider  Lam Research has a high exposure in the memory segment, which is likely to witness notable growth in the coming quarters, driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT. The company is doing well of late and expects to flourish in areas such as device architecture, process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections. It continues to witness increased adoption rates for 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. The company has undertaken cost-reduction activities as well as density scaling for 3D NAND, and new memory technologies. All these factors are likely to positively impact the top line of the company. For the quarter to be reported, the company expects revenues to be approximately $2.5 billion (+/- $150 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $2.50 billion. However, volatility in the PC market remains a major concern. Weakness in the PCs may offset the expansion in the 3D NAND, impacting its fiscal second-quarter results. Also, the company faces significant competition in all its product and service categories in the semiconductor capital equipment market.

  Walmart Inc. WMT  made yet another move to enhance grocery delivery services by joining hands with Point Pickup, Skipcart, AxleHire and Roadie. These collaborations are expected to strengthen Walmart's online grocery delivery service in four states, with plans of greater expansions going ahead.  makeArticleAd();  Notably, Walmart has been stepping up its online grocery delivery game for quite some time now in an effort to counter Amazon's AMZN  growing dominance. Courtesy of such efforts, Walmart Grocery Delivery can be now availed across more than 800 stores, with plans to add another 800 this year. In fact, considering the rising demand for online grocery, major retailers like Kroger KR  and Target TGT  are undertaking efforts to expand in this arena to stay afloat in the retail game.    Coming back to Walmart, the company is committed to enrich consumers' experiences by providing easy shopping methods and seamless grocery deliveries. To this end, the company's alliance with Jet.com and Blue Apron to provide on-demand meal kits is noteworthy. Also, Walmart recently raised its stake in Dada-JD Daojia to 10% to strengthen its last-mile delivery service and further enhance omni-channel offering. In an earlier development, the company inked a deal with Postmates to extend its online grocery delivery service to cover more than 40% of the families in the United States.    Also, the company's contract with DoorDash, acquisition of last-mile delivery service Parcel Inc along with the move to introduce a completely new line of kitchen products in collaboration with Buzzfeed's Tasty, highlights focus on enhancing grocery sales. Further, the company's Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and then pick them up at a store for free. Moreover, Walmart partnered with ride hailing services Uber and Lyft for quick online grocery deliveries, while it tested same-day delivery with Deliv to enhance its services further.    Strength in online grocery sales along with other e-commerce efforts boosted Walmart's overall U.S. e-commerce sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. During the quarter, U.S. e-commerce sales surged 43% (better than 40% growth recorded in the second quarter). E-commerce sales improved on the back of enhanced online assortment and increased grocery pickups.

503,"January 18, 2019, 08:11:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Will End-Markets Uptick Benefit Xilinx (XLNX) Q3 Earnings?,"
  Xilinx XLNX  is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jan 23. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four reported quarters, the average positive surprise being 8.74%. In the las t report  ed quarter, the company delivered earnings of 87 cents per share, much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents and the prior-year quarter's figure of 65 cents. Revenues increased 19% year over year to $746.3 million and outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $710.3 million. For third-quarter fiscal 2019, Xilinx projects revenues in the range of $760-$780 million. Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.  Factors at Play  Xilinx is benefiting from growth across majority of the end markets. Solid performances of its Communications businesses and broad based growth at Data Center, Testing, Measurement, and Emulation (TME) plus Industrial segments are buoying investor confidence in the company's near-term prospects. In the last reported quarter, better-than-expected growth in wired revenues was a positive. Moreover, a strong wireless business, which benefited from LTE upgrades, early deployment of 5G across multiple geographies and preparation for 5G deployment, drove results. Although management expects 5G to ramp up mostly in 2020, acceleration in deployments, particularly in Korea, makes it optimistic. Moreover, the company expects a strong uptick from Data Center and TME segment, Industrial, Aerospace and Defense (A&D) segment as well. A&D, which declined in the last reported quarter, is expected to recover in the December quarter. We are optimistic about the surge in demand for Xilinx's Ultrascale+ FPGAs among data-center operators for providing FPGA-as-a-Service (FaaS). On the last   earnings call  , management mentioned that Amazon AMZN  Web Services doubled its FaaS availability zones to 8.  Moreover, the company's leadership position in the Chinese market with regard to FaaS expanded with Alibaba BABA  moving from beta to general access. Xilinx's successful product portfolio also looks impressive. Significantly, the company's first and second-generation Zynq products hit a new sales record in the last reported quarter, soaring 76% year over year, driven by robust demand in the automotive, industrial, communications and data center markets. However, Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive revenues are anticipated to be approximately flat in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Increase in operating expense due to higher employee compensation including profit sharing and sales incentive as well as the full integration of the DeePhi acquisition is an overhang on margins.

504,"January 18, 2019, 06:59:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Should John Hancock Multifactor Large Cap ETF (JHML) Be on Your Investing Radar?,"
 If you're interested in broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, look no further than the John Hancock Multifactor Large Cap ETF (JHML), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 09/28/2015. The fund is sponsored by John Hancock. It has amassed assets over $773.33 M, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.  Why Large Cap Blend  Companies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies. Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.  Costs  Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts if all other fundamentals are the same. Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.35%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space. It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.49%.  Sector Exposure and Top Holdings  Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 18.70% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three. Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 2.63% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN). The top 10 holdings account for about 11.76% of total assets under management.  Performance and Risk  JHML seeks to match the performance of the John Hancock Dimensional Large Cap Index before fees and expenses. The John Hancock Dimensional Large Cap Index comprises of a subset of securities in the U.S. Universe issued by companies whose market capitalizations are larger than that of the 801st largest U.S. company. The ETF has added about 5.37% so far this year and is down about -5.66% in the last one year (as of 01/18/2019). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $30.10 and $37.87. The ETF has a beta of 1.03 and standard deviation of 12.60% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 779 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.  Alternatives  John Hancock Multifactor Large Cap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, JHML is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $157.58 B in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $249.44 B. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.04% and SPY charges 0.09%.  Bottom-Line  While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.

508,"January 18, 2019, 02:57:00 AM EDT",AMZN,Zacks.com,Apple Likely to Lower Hiring Rate at Divisions Except AI Team,"
makeZacksArticleAd();Per Bloomberg, AppleAAPL is planning to reduce the rate of hiring in some of its divisions, except the artificial intelligence (AI) team. The cut-back reflects the ramification of fewer iPhone sales in the holiday quarter.
 Apple lowered its quarterly sales guidance on Jan 2, citing weak iPhone demand in Greater China and fewer upgrades to its flagship device. Notably, in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, Greater China accounted for 18.1% of total sales, which increased 16% year over year to $11.41 billion.
 Moreover, Nikkei recently reported that Apple is lowering its new iPhone production plan by almost 10% for the next three months. The cut applies to all three iPhone models. Notably, in December 2018, the company had lowered its new iPhone production target for the January-March quarter.AI Gaining More Importance at Apple
 Per the Bloomberg report, the pace of hiring at the AI team will remain strong, which reflects Apple's increasing focus on AI. According to CEO Tim Cook, ""Machine learning and AI are important to Apple's future as they are fundamentally changing the way people interact with technology, and already helping our customers live better lives.""
 Apple's initiatives on infusing AI and machine learning in its solutions and devices are noteworthy. For instance, the company's A11 Bionic 64-bit chip features a ""Neural Engine"", which is the built-in neural network hardware. This component performs up to 600 billion operations per second and uses machine learning to deliver features such as Face ID and Animoji.
 Moreover, Apple is encouraging developers to use AI in their apps. The company's Core ML 2 API helps developers recognize faces or animals in photos, or parse the meaning of text. Per ZDNet, Core ML 2 framework offers 30% faster on-device processing and helps reduce model size by 75%.Further, at 2018 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), the company introduced Create ML for simple and efficient machine learning training on the Mac. Create ML is built on top of Swift programming language.Apple Inc. Price and ConsensusApple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. QuoteNotably, Apple has hired former Google head of search and AI, John Giannandrea, to lead its restructured AI division that includes the machine learning division, Siri team, and the Core ML API team. In addition to all these, acquisition of start-ups like Silk Labs enhances the company's expertise in the domain.Can AI-Driven Services Business Rescue Apple's Dwindling Fortunes?
 The Services segment has become the new cash cow for Apple and is expected to grow strongly, driven by increasing popularity of App-Store, Apple Music and Apple Pay.
 In the las t report ed quarter, Services revenues increased 17% year over year to $9.98 billion and accounted for 15.9% of sales. Apple stated that paid subscriptions have surpassed $330 million, an increase of more than 50% year over year. We believe that growing numbers of AI-infused apps will attract more subscribers on App Store. This will further boost top-line growth.
 Moreover, Apple's endeavors to open up its ecosystem, through partnerships with the likes of Samsung SSNLF and Amazon AMZN , are positive for the Services segment.
 The Samsung deal will allow users to easily watch iTunes movies and TV shows on the Korean electronics giant's smart TVs. Samsung also noted that it will add Apple's AirPlay 2 software to the TVs, thereby allowing iPhone and iPad users to stream their device content on smart TVs.  
 Moreover, Apple Music's availability on Amazon Echo devices is expected to boost the iPhone-makers' footprint against Spotify SPOT , which is currently the dominant player in the paid, premium music streaming market. Spotify has a user base of 191 million compared with that of Apple's more than 50 million.
 Further, Apple Pay's expanding international footprint is a key catalyst. In December last year, the company launched Apple Pay in Germany. The service is supported by 15 banks, including Deutsche Bank.

Reuters

@media screen and (max-device-width: 480px){body{ font-size:30pt !important;}}



VIENNA, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Apple  and Amazon  are among eight tech firms named in a complaint filed in Austria by non-profit organisation noyb, which cited their failure to comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The action by noyb, chaired by data privacy activist Max Schrems, also named Netflix, Spotify  and Youtube, after it tested them by requesting private data the companies hold about the user.
""No service fully complied,"" noyb said in its statement.makeAd('4','300x250','mktsnews','article','','');
The GDPR foresees fines of up to 4 percent of global revenues for companies that break the rules.
Noyb said it filed its complaints with the Austrian authority on behalf of 10 users. The Austrian watchdog would have to work with its counterparts at the streaming services' main establishments.
""Many services set up automated systems to respond to access requests, but they often don't even remotely provide the data that every user has a right to,"" Schrems said. ""This leads to structural violations of users' rights, as these systems are built to withhold the relevant information.""
Schrems is a veteran privacy campaigner who took his first legal action against Facebook  as a student in 2011.
Now a lawyer, Schrems filed complaints last year against Google, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing they were acting illegally by forcing users to accept intrusive terms of service or lose access.
