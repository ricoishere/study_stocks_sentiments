[Q] Switching Mutual Fund to Stock Portfolio - Wise For Stability?,1,7s8dj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7s8dj1/q_switching_mutual_fund_to_stock_portfolio_wise/,5,1516679099.0,"Heya folks.  
  
Young guy here. Started working a real job a couple years ago, and my parents hooked me up with our long time Investors Group lady. Shortly after opening an account with them, monthly deposits and all, I began looking into stock trading and used extra money to dabble. I've been enjoying it thus far.  
  
Now, I recently got my 1/4ly statement from IG regarding my fund, which has a considerable amount of money now (for me) and it only netted me a $30 return in a conservative IG Mutual Fund. The original plan was for something stable to grow my money towards buying a house, but this is a whole other result from 'grow' than what I was expecting. It's quite literally a .001% return for the quarter, or if these trends continue, .004% over a year. I think IG has made more money off me than I ended up pocketing... The money I did make from this account is beyond laughable compared to my fractional investments into stocks, which have netted me considerably better returns.  
  
**My question is this:** If I were to invest in stable, blue chip stocks (AMZN, BABA, HD, LOW, FB, GOOGL, etc etc), would this be a reasonable practice in order to help jump start myself towards building money towards a house? I've already got some money invested in the market from place to place, mostly feeling around but doing okay thus far, so I feel like I could have good judgement on what blue chips to pick. My real question is whether or not blue chips would be too much added risk compared to a conservative fund through an institution? I'm thinking it would be acceptable, since I could get a considerably higher return and maintain some stability, but I would like further opinions on the matter.

Should I sell AAPL to buy NVDA?,2,7sylhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7sylhn/should_i_sell_aapl_to_buy_nvda/,18,1516937221.0,"I invested $5200.00 total in the market a month ago and as a huge fan of tech stocks so I invested a grand each in AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, FB and GOOGL. I am starting to get cold feet on AAPL and it just seems to be lagging this year, NVDA seems to be hot and I see nothing but positive news about it.

I could either A. Keep AAPL and use a grand on margin to buy NVDA or sell AAPL (I would break even) and use that grand to buy NVDA",2018-01-26 11:27:01

# **WEEK AHEAD: Big week for markets up next, with Fed meeting, earnings tsunami and Trump State of the Union address** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/big-week-for-markets-with-fed-meeting-earnings-tsunami-and-trump-state-of-union.html)*

*****

> * President Trump's State of the Union Speech, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's final meeting, and a wave of earnings and economic news will give markets plenty of catalysts in the week ahead.
> * Analysts are watching for an asset reallocation by pension funds.
* Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet all report Wednesday and Thursday.
> * The S&P 500 is up more than 7 percent for the month so far, its best performance since 2015.

*****

> President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's farewell meeting and a tsunami of earnings reports from tech's heaviest hitters are some of the big events for markets in the week ahead.
*****
> The stock market could continue its record-setting run as month end approaches, and the S&P 500 is already on track for a 7.2 percent January gain so far, its best gain since October 2015. If positive, January would be the 10th month of gains for the Dow and S&P, the best consecutive monthly winning streak since 1959.
*****
> Stock investors will focus on a range of events, including President Trump's State of the Union address and his expected promise of a major infrastructure spending plan. The president is expected to ask Congress for $200 billion.
*****
> More than a fifth of the S&P 500 companies release earnings, with reports from Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet on Wednesday and Thursday, and from big oil, including ExxonMobil and Chevron, on Friday.
*****
> The Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady Wednesday, in the final meeting before Chair Janet Yellen leaves at the end of the week and Fed governor Jerome Powell moves to the chairmanship. The Fed is expected to raise rates again in March, and it forecasts three interest rate hikes this year.
*****
> ""I suspect there's not going to be a massive change. Their views are going to be about the same. You will definitely see more conversation about regulation from him,"" said Seth Carpenter, UBS chief U.S. economist.
*****
> There are also some major data releases in the coming week, as the calendar rolls to February from January, with car sales, manufacturing and productivity data Thursday and the always important monthly employment report on Friday.
*****
> The roll of the calendar itself could be a big event, as investors position for the end of a month where stocks soared and bonds sold off. Some strategists expect to see a continued reallocation from pension funds, which set their allocations in January. Treasury bonds have sold off, with the 10-year yield reaching close to its high of 2.47 percent Friday, and the 2-year piercing 2.13 percent, after starting the year at 1.89. Yields move opposite prices.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC:**
February’s performance generally improves in midterm years**

> Since 1950, February is up only slightly more than half the time and up marginally on average. However, small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the seventh best month for that benchmark.

> In midterm years, February’s performance generally improves with average returns all increasing. Here again it is the Russell 2000 small-cap index that shines brightest gaining 1.9% on average since 1982. Russell 1000 is second best, averaging gains of 1.3% since 1982. DJIA and S&P 500 average gains of 1.0% (since 1950) while NASDAQ lags with average advance of 0.7% (since 1974).

# **The Energizer Market**

> The S&P 500 notched yet another new all-time high today. Below is an updated look at our tables highlighting the length of days it has been since the last meaningful pullback.

> As shown, we’re now at 445 days since the last 3%+ pullback (a record), 575 days since the last 5%+ pullback (18 days from a record), 712 days since the last 10%+ pullback (not close to a record), and 3,242 days since the last 20%+ pullback (2nd longest).

*****

# **Another 100+ Trading Day Streak Without a 1%+ Decline**

> We’ve been saying this for a while now, but the next time the S&P 500 experiences a drop of more than 1%, it’s going to feel like a crash to many investors. That’s because 1%+ down days have become so foreign lately. As investors get used to only very small declines on very rare occasions, drops of 1%-2% — which were much more frequent up until the end of 2016 — feel MUCH more painful when they finally do occur.

> Below is a chart showing historical streaks of trading days without a 1%+ down day going back to 1945. While the current streak of 108 trading days isn’t that close to the record streak of 184 trading days seen back in 1963, it’s notable that we just had a 109-trading day streak end last March as well.

> Prior to the two recent 100+ trading day streaks without a 1%+ down day, the last two came back in 1995. 1995 was a year that saw very similar action to what we’ve seen over the last 12 months.

###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/1pcttradingdays.png))**

> If we tighten up the margin of the decline even more, the S&P 500 has not had a decline of 0.60% in 96 trading days. As shown below, that’s easily a record going back to 1945!

ATTN long term holders.. How often do you check your stocks?,1,7uejoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7uejoh/attn_long_term_holders_how_often_do_you_check/,4,1517472227.0,"I am transitioning from being a short term trader to now buying and holding long term. I just invested 7 grand a month ago and loaded up exclusively on tech stocks (AMZN, INTC, NVDA, FB, MSFT, GOOGL and AAPL)

As a millennial (33 years old) I absolutely love tech and the companies I listed above that have amazing products and services that I know and use daily.

I'm looking at holding 5-10 years. So my question is, how often do you check stocks. I look at mine daily, multiple times a day but feel it's a waste of time considering I'm holding for the long haul

"Lucky, but now need your help!",4,7uf3rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7uf3rg/lucky_but_now_need_your_help/,2,1517477347.0,"Hey Reddit! Been checking out reddit for 4 years+ now--I guess it's time I finally post something! Hopefully I don't get reamed too hard and I am in the right spot...
&nbsp; 
&nbsp;



I'm hoping to get some guidance from you all regarding my portfolio.  I've really only started investing about 2 years ago and the purpose of this portfolio is just to buy and hold.  Every month I put about $1,000 into the account and and try and keep an evenISH balance across the portfolio.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;  

  

  
**Anyway, here's my concern.**   
I know that I've been very lucky to come into the market when I have, but I'm concerned that (1) that my portfolio is not as diversified as it should be and (2) when the market drops, I'll feel it harder than I should.  I blame it on the market lulling me into believing that I actually know what I'm doing when really a monkey probably outperformed me this year.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;  

  

   
So, without further ado, would you mind just taking a quick look at my current portfolio and letting me know your thoughts and concerns.  It would be greatly appreciated. Quick note that the a small handful of these holdings (the *italicized ones*) are from this week when I started realizing I'm way to tech heavy...

Last night I made a post saying I was going to sell it all because the futures being down a grand scared me.

But I slept on it and came to the conclusion that all my investing years I have always played it too conservative and played not to lose instead of playing to win and always sold at the hint of trouble, I realized I never made money doing this and simply went the opposite route and bought more! 

So I pulled a 180, slid all my chips to the center of the table and used my full margin to buy in today and did some dollar cost averaging on stocks I bought a month ago.

Dont worry, I bought solid, blue chip companies, some with good dividends to offset the margin interest . My portfolio now consists of NFLX, AMZN, GOOGL, FB, PYPL, NVDA, MSFT, INTC and AAPL. All tech baby!

I told myself that I am doing this for the long term (5-10 years) and I will not sell a single share, so either A. I'm going to profit or B. I will get margin called because that's the only way I'm selling.",2018-02-07 12:23:51

Kostin recommends six buy-rated names: Alphabet(GOOGL), Amazon(AMZN), Domino’s Pizza(DPZ), Fortinet(FTNT), Summit Materials(SUM), and Ulta Beauty(ULTA). Among all, Amazon has the highest estimated sales growth in 2018—34%. (you can explore detailed info about these six stocks in FuninUSA)

This is like the all-star week for earnings! Feel like this is going to either make or break the bull market. What are your plans this week?,1,8edohw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/8edohw/this_is_like_the_allstar_week_for_earnings_feel/,11,1524536618.0,"I will just use the WSB post for the image link to the [earnings calendar](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8dvsev/most_anticipated_earnings_releases_for_the_week/).

But look at the big names: Google (Alphabet), Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Visa, 3M, Boeing, Comcast, AT&T, Intel. And of course I shall not forget the meme stock AMD.

I am holding my breath for the GOOGL earnings AH. Not just because I hold GOOGL, but this could determine where the market is going to head for a long time after this week. The market has been in a bumpy ride since early Feb, NFLX's mighty ER can barely create a fake rally.

What are your plans this week? Anyone hedging?

Big technology stocks have soared in recent years as their rapid earnings and revenue growth made them must-have holdings in many investors' portfolios. Now, a new engine is likely to drive tech profits and stock prices in the coming years: ongoing streams of revenues from customer subscriptions, The Wall Street Journal reports. Software was the first area within the tech sector to change its preferred pricing model from one-time sales to recurring annual fees, the Journal notes. Today, the subscription pricing model has become pervasive throughout the sector, and companies that have embraced it include Apple Inc.

As earnings season continues, one thing is becoming clear: tech is king.

Coming into Q1 releases, conventional wisdom was that sectors such as energy and financials would be the big winners. Tech, on the other hand, had largely led the moves down over the last couple of months, and was not often mentioned as a place to be. Energy earnings are, as expected, showing tremendous growth, which is hardly surprising if you so much as glance at a chart showing oil prices, while early in the season most financial firms did reveal the expected increase in trading profits.

The headline grabbers, however, have been in tech, and especially big tech.

The big four, Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOGL), collectively known as the FANG stocks, have all reported EPS beats, ranging from a penny in the case of Netflix to a massive 168% upside surprise from Amazon. Now that we have all their earnings, it is time to take stock, if you’ll forgive the pun.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week of October 22nd - 26th, 2018.

# **Dow snaps 3-week losing streak, Procter & Gamble surges** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/wall-street-futures-point-to-a-slight-rebound-after-the-dow-sheds-300-points.html)*

* The Dow rises 0.4 percent this week, notching its first weekly gain in four.
* The 30-stock index's gains on Friday are led by Procter & Gamble's biggest one-day surge in a decade.
* Stocks remain down sharply for the month, however, as worries about rates and the global economy persist.
* ""The market is not going to have an immediate recovery; it tends to bounce,"" says Quincy Krosby of Prudential Financial.

*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Friday on the back of strong earnings from Procter & Gamble as Wall Street tried to regain its footing after a sharp sell-off in the prior session.
*****
> The 30-stock index climbed 64.89 points to 25,444.34, led by a 8.8 percent surge in Procter & Gamble shares, their biggest since Oct. 28, 2008. The Dow also posted its first weekly gain in four, climbing 0.4 percent in that time. Procter surged after reporting better-than-expected earnings. The company said it got a boost from strong beauty-product sales.
*****
> Honeywell and Schlumberger also reported better-than-forecast profits. American Express, PayPal and Skechers all posted on Thursday earnings that topped analyst expectations. Their shares rose 3.8 percent, 9.4 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively.
*****
> The corporate earnings season is off to a strong start. With more than 15 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported, 83 percent have topped analyst expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
> The S&P 500 closed just below the flatline at 2,767.78, however, as declines in health care and consumer discretionary offset a 2.3 percent gain in consumer staples. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 percent to 7,449.03 as Facebook, Amazon and Netflix all pulled back.
*****
> ""The underpinnings of the economy are still in place and earnings are still good,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. ""The market is not going to have an immediate recovery; it tends to bounce.""
*****
> These moves follow a sell-off on in the previous session as investors worried about rising rates, geopolitical tensions and a potential slowdown in the global economy.
*****
> ""The rising rates, rising volatility and the moves in currencies were a wake-up call"" for investors, said Gibson Smith, founder of Smith Capital Investors. ""Earnings should be supportive of stocks,"" but the market is entering a period where it is ""realizing the economy is in stronger footing.""
*****
> On Thursday, the Dow dropped more than 300 points, following a plunge in Chinese equities. History shows that, when stocks plunge in China, the U.S. market is rarely immune as large exporters suffer.
*****
> Overnight, China said its economy grew by 6.5 percent in the third quarter, missing expectations. Chinese equities surged, however, as officials took steps to support the market, and that was helping sentiment in the U.S.
*****
> Stocks are down sharply for the month.The Dow and S&P 500 have fallen more than 3 percent each in October, while the Nasdaq is down more than 7 percent.
*****
> ""This whole thing started a few weeks ago when [Federal Reserve] Chairman Jerome Powell said we're a long way from neutral,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. ""What we're seeing here is a good old fashion valuation repricing.""
*****
> Schutte added these recent pullback is a buying opportunity for investors.

# Third-Quarter Earnings Preview: What to Watch

> Third-quarter earnings season effectively kicks off today, and it should be another good one. S&P 500 Index companies are expected to report their ninth consecutive increase in profits and third consecutive quarter with earnings growth of over 20%. We expect these strong earnings gains to be driven mostly by solid economic growth, particularly manufacturing, and tax cuts—though higher oil prices should give energy sector profits a nice boost. The interest rate environment has gotten better for financials recently, which also helps.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Another-Quarter-of-20-Earnings-Growth-Likely-on-Tap.jpg?ssl=1))**

> We like looking at company pre-announcements ahead of reporting season to get a sense of where results may come in. At 2.1, the ratio of negative to positive pre-announcements for the third quarter is higher (or more negative) than the second quarter and last year’s third quarter, but lower than the long-term average of 2.8 (Thomson Reuters’ data since 1995). We interpret this as a positive indicator of upside to S&P 500 earnings estimates, but the potential upside is more modest than in recent quarters.

> Similarly, earnings estimate revisions can tell us something about how results will come in. Third-quarter estimates have held steady since the quarter ended on September 30, but estimates were cut by 1.6% during the quarter. The good news is that the reduction in earnings is lower than the average reduction, suggesting that results will probably exceed estimates, as they typically do.

> So what should investors be watching during earnings season? We highlight these three factors:

> **Profit margin pressure**. In general, companies continue to do an excellent job controlling costs and keeping their profit margins high. But tariffs, (slowly) rising borrowing costs, and budding wage pressures have put the market on notice for potential narrowing of profit margins.

> **Profit growth peak**. We will again hear about peak profit growth this quarter. A peak in earnings growth is very different from an earnings decline, something we see as a long way off. “Historically, about four years have passed, on average, between an S&P 500 earnings growth peak and the next recession, during which stocks have produced solid gains,” notes our Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch.

> **China-U.S. trade tensions**. China will be important to watch again this earnings season given tariffs, the ongoing trade dispute, and related slower growth in the Chinese economy, which has pressured its stock market. We also expect to hear a lot about how companies are preparing for additional potential tariffs on Chinese goods, and whether they are seeing business in China drop off.

# The Calendar Is a Bull’s Best Friend

> “October: This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.” — Mark Twain

> After six straight months of equity gains for the S&P 500 Index and one of the least volatile quarters ever, the historically volatile October is living up to its name. However, earnings continue to be very strong, and we see very little reason to expect a recession over the next 12–18 months. By no means are investors out of the woods yet, as we wouldn’t be surprised to see more weakness and volatility before the midterm elections. Remember, the S&P 500 dropped for nine straight days ahead of the U.S. election in November 2016. Nevertheless, there may be a silver lining for the bulls.

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the majority of stock gains in midterm years have come late in the year. “Midterm years have tended to be the most volatile out of the four-year presidential cycle, and wouldn’t you know it, nearly all the gains for the year tended to happen in the final few months,” explained LPL Research Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Gains-During-a-MIdterm-Year-Tended-to-Happen-Late.jpg?ssl=1))**

> On average, the S&P 500 actually has been negative year to date ate in early October during a midterm year. Importantly, markets can be jittery ahead of major events like elections. Once the uncertainty is resolved in November, solid fundamentals and strong seasonals could take over for a nice year-end rally.

Interested in your thoughts. 

What's your target price for this stock? Do you think it’s a buy?",2018-10-25 03:31:21
What a bloodbath,16,9r4fqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9r4fqt/what_a_bloodbath/,4,1540449015.0,"Well. Figured I'd mention it since things are rather mum about it. And this is quite baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad (lamb sound).

That being said, this is reminding me a lot of February.

So best and only tactic is to do what we did in February. A recap.

If you're in cash, either stay out and watch the show. Or buy some damn good bargains today. Google down 5%. Disney down 5%. Are you kidding me? 

Or maybe it might be a time to make some money off inverse ETFs. I never bothered because that's playing with fire but that's an option as well.

The key is to only invest in companies where you believe in the company so much that no matter what happens, it's a win for you. 

If it rallies, it rallies. 

If it doesn't, it's a goddamn bargain and you buy hand-over-fist. 

I feel that way about Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Disney (DIS) right now. 

If Google (GOOGL) should dip tomorrow on its earnings tomorrow, I'll buy more. 

And that's all for today. 

I'll report back when I'm either broke off buying Google stock or when things are good and we realize that Google is still an awesome company, product, service and stock.

#**DISCUSS!**

What is on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Friday, October 26th, 2018! :)**",2018-10-27 04:54:00
"Semiconductor stocks - understand the cycle. MU, NVDA, TXN, AMAT, SOX",185,9rnnrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9rnnrc/semiconductor_stocks_understand_the_cycle_mu_nvda/,63,1540609753.0," 

I though I would write a short post for some of the youngins here who have never experienced a real correction or know what a market cycle is.

1. The overall stock market is in correction mode now. That is pretty clear. How far it goes I dont know. Is this the start of a bear market i dont know either but I do know that if you look at times when the S&P 500 stays under the 200 day moving average, you need to be careful
2. Specifically regarding semiconductor stocks, they are cyclical stocks and you have to know the rules to play by. When I see people saying buy MU bc its cheap I just laugh. Its always cheap at the top, thats how cyclical stocks work. While I do think MU is actually cheap based on their assets and LT potiential, looking at current or even foretasted earnings is not the right way. you need to understand that with cyclical stocks, you buy when things go from bad to good and you sell when things go from good to bad. For months there have been signs that the semi cycle is topping out. Suppliers like LAM and AMAT topped out a while ago as demand is slowing. And then you had KLAC at a conference a few weeks ago talking about order growth slowing and then TXN finally confirmed that we are in a semi slowdown. Why? Well basically the market was so tight the past 12 months that everyone double ordered, and the Book/Bill for the entire industry was around 2. Clearly there actually wasnt the amount of demand but suppliers had run out of stock so ppl want to make sure they got their orders. Now we also have a slowdown from China (some ppl front ran the tarrifs ) and autos are slowing big time. Look BWA and all the auto parts companies. You also had huge hyper scaler data center build-outs the past 2 years, which messed up the market. DRAM prices were rising for over a year. Thats not normal, prices usually always go down. Why bc MSFT , GOOGL and others wanted to catch up to AWS. They will keep spending but I would expect the market to be more prepared now.

The good thing about the semi cycle nowadays is that there is a lot more demand than just PC's or smartphones. So eventually it will come back. And IMO we are probably half way through it already. Asian semi's and suppliers got the message a long time ago. Look to them for the first signs of a bottom.

> Recent economic data have reignited worries of economic slowdown around the globe and kept a lid on stock returns. The Dow fell nearly 500 points and the S&P 500 closed down 1.9 percent on Friday to 2,599.95 — its lowest closing level since April — after China reported industrial output and retail sales growth numbers for November that missed expectations.
*****
> The latest economic data offered yet another hint that Beijing’s economy may be decelerating amid rising trade risks as President Xi Jinping tries to broker a permanent truce with President Donald Trump.

The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to hike its benchmark overnight lending rate for a fourth and final time of 2018 this week. While fears of rising interest rates and an ambitious Fed have spooked markets throughout 2018, such concerns have evolved over the past month as inflation and growth expectations recede.

Started investing in October... what an education. Looking for advice.,66,a9m2tc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/a9m2tc/started_investing_in_october_what_an_education/,73,1545832755.0,"I've nearly made it to 40 (years old) without dabbling in the stock-market. Only minor investing done through work retirement accounts, bonds, and things of that nature. But with a few hundred thousand just sitting around doing nothing, I decided back in August to start trying to learn about investing in stocks to get my money working for me. Needless to say - what and education it has been.

&#x200B;

Invested a modest 10k (apprx) between Aug & October in a mixture of INTC, GOOGL, AMZN, SQ, VZ, AMD, NFLX, PEGI, NVDA. I was quite pleased with earning about 5% by October but boy, what a time to start investing. Down over 3k from about 10k (down to about 6.9k now.)

&#x200B;

As a new investor, losing over a quarter of my investment in a few months with no end in sight is a bit of a shock.

&#x200B;

I'm assuming the advice at this point is ""Hang on. Keep investing"", but just want to hear the opinion of the masses. At this rate it's probably going to take me well over a year or two to regain what I've already lost.

&#x200B;

My reasonable, amateur inclination is to give it a little more time until there's an upward trend and invest another 10k over a few months to expedite the recovery. But I see other people on subs here suggesting they've sold the bulk of their positions and are waiting out the bear. Maybe that's the right strategy given the current circumstances? Should I consider moving a big chunk of my funds to some well-performing ETFs? Just don't have a lot of knowledge about those. Does it seem foolish to just hang on at this point, having invested at the peak of the bull, when it seems universally agreed we've still got a long way to fall?

&#x200B;

What do you suggest?
