The bits and pieces I've heard seem to feel that Netflix is overvalued, but I want to know why people think that way. I've had a share of netflix since the summer and recently bought another one before the dip (rip) at 269, but it seems to have already bounced back. Do you all think Netflix still has a lot of room for growth, or is that already accounted for? Netflix seems to be getting a stronger grounding on the legal anime streaming community. Thoughts on that and how well they'll monetize it? How do you think the subscribers would respond to another price increase in a year or so (or is that too far out there to predict)?  
To give some context, I'm still learning the ropes (just practicing right now). I'm started investing at the end of this past summer with $1000 and I'm currently up 12-15%.

$NFLX V. $DIS,13,80wobf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/80wobf/nflx_v_dis/,33,1519859047.0,"$NFLX V. $DIS is a common comparison. Looking deeper into these companies it’s hard to justify $NFLX valuation of 126B compared to $DIS valuation of 157B. 

I understand $NFLX has growth potential but so does $DIS, along with a greater array of assets. $DIS has better content, a streaming service, the top sports broadcasting network, a news network, a top movie studio and all of the Disney parks. With the high profile fox buy, $DIS acquired a majority holding in Hulu. Netflix has over 3 times more active users compared to Hulu, meaning there is more room for Hulu to grow than Netflix. $DIS now has the ability to optimize Hulu and stream their original content on the streaming platform, which should lead to greater future growth.

With all of this said $DIS stock has remained stagnant or decreased, while $NFLX has increased greatly. 

Can someone explain this to me or justify $NFLX valuation?

Is Autodesk (ADSK) a good candidate for a short-term trading short?,1,83hzkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/83hzkw/is_autodesk_adsk_a_good_candidate_for_a_shortterm/,11,1520744655.0,"Autodesk (ADSK) shares popped this week.

Given what I heard from the conference call, I didn't expect ADSK to do much.  To me the headline was nearly identical to the headline last quarter... a beat on top and bottom lines... and subs were lower... essentially the same headline that cratered the stock about 15%.  

While they did announced a layoff last quarter, there was no such layoff this quarter... so that's a positive... but, maybe balancing that was the guided lower this quarter vs. higher last quarter... which is usually a big negative.

Clearly the stock was on fire in the after market after this quarter's report came out... and that carried through to the next day trading as well... up almost 15%.

So I think it's swung too far.  I can see the positives in the quarter temporarily taking out the old high (around $131)... but it just hit $140 today... that seem too much... feels like it should be trading at 125-130.  (Notably today ADSK seems to be lagging behind the rest of the on-fire market.)

In addition, I wouldn't put it past Trump to roil up the markets again soon... and, there really should be a second leg down from the midi-crash of a few weeks ago... we have come very far very fast.

So, I think ADSK is a good candidate for a short-term trading short.

Any thoughts?

Can some please ELI5 Options to me? Particularly puts.,3,88jfg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/88jfg9/can_some_please_eli5_options_to_me_particularly/,18,1522539588.0,"Hi all,

I need just a quick explanation on puts and how, under what conditions I can be profitable buying a specific put for a specific date. Or rather, which put I should buy, given my prediction for price action over the coming months.

Basically, I'm of the belief that a crash is fairly likely in the next year, let's not get into that particular debate but let's just assume this is my mindset. I want to buy puts on such over-valued gems as NFLX and TSLA and maybe FB and TWTR and GOOG given the recent FUD on those names and the potential crash I see. But I can't figure out which option to buy and will be profitable at the time closer to expiry if said crash does happen.

Let's just do NFLX as I can extrapolate my belief systems about the others and pick the proper puts once I figure this out. So I suspect NFLX will be sub $200 by next January. I want to buy puts that will be very profitable next January if indeed we see NFLX sub $200. So, should I be looking at the strike price primarily? Obviously I'm looking at January 2019 puts right now. I see $200 strike price, the premium is $9.50ish right now. So what does that mean, like if I buy that option for $9.50, under what conditions will I be profitable come next January or come the crash say if it hits in June or September or whenever if it is well ahead of January?

I know I should probably not buy puts if this stuff isn't clear to me, I have not purchased any and I won't until I am clear on this stuff. This is what I'm trying to do. So let's just look at a few January 2019 NFLX puts, and can you guys explain the various conditions that may take place for that put to be profitable?

$200 strike, $9.50 premium

$150 strike, $4.20 premium

$100 strike, $0.70 premium

And if I wanna go real YOLO with maybe just a few contracts. $50 strike, $0.15 premium.

Or is it easier for me to just say, NFLX, January 2019, if it is $175ish at the time (my belief is it could be there abouts by then) which put should I buy today for the best return? If I get the $200 put for example, and by January 2019 NFLX is $150, then that's bad and I lose either way? Or do I win simply because NFLX is significantly lower then than it is now? This is kinda where my confusion is laying right now.

The plan is probably not to hold until expiry, just hold until it is a highly profitable position, or I guess until what? NFLX reaches the strike price or lower? Then I can exercise for profits? See this is where I'm getting confused here...I'm just not sure, for all of these puts, just how low NFLX has to go for them to become highly profitable positions whether via trading, or via exercising. If NFLX falls to $240 in the next month, do we expect to see really any rise in the $50 strike price options, for example?

Damn options are confusing, I think I get calls a bit more. Like You get a $300 call for $45.58, if by January 2019 NFLX is $345.58 or higher and the option expires, you can buy NFLX shares for $300 + the $45.58 you paid for the option so you are profitable to some extent or another, like if NFLX is $400 you've profited over $50 per share if exercised, I get that, that seems pretty straight forward. But puts are confusing me a bit more, and I'm currently looking bearish, so I want puts not calls of course.

Thanks so much whoever takes the time to read and explain to an options noob like myself. :)

Also do I really need to worry about covered calls? What exactly is that compared to just ""calls""? And are there covered puts? Or a ""covered call"" equivalent in puts?

Thank you :)",2018-04-01 07:39:48

Basically the deal will enable Disney to provide a direct to consumer service with a disgusting amount of exclusive content that they know how to monetize in ways that only Disney can. They can now offer new blockbuster movies exclusively through their service and I'm wondering if even movie theaters will have to subscribe if they want to put it on their big screens. That means that Disney can now use their best assets(movies that attract audiences of all ages and backgrounds) to increase subscriber growth and it also puts them in complete control of digital advertising(basically FANG's bread and butter) on their platform which i'm sure will be in very high demand from companies with a lot of money to spend. When you add all of that up with an already successful parks and resorts business, I just don't see how they can screw this up. There is nothing really stopping them from carving out a center in the digital space and perhaps joining FANG in those high price valuations. what am i missing here? I know that they are traditionally not a tech stock and that could be a challenge for them as they enter the space, but if they acquire fox, hulu will fall into their lap, and that is not a bad start.

Only minor investing done through work retirement accounts, bonds, and things of that nature. But with a few hundred thousand just sitting around doing nothing, I decided back in August to start trying to learn about investing in stocks to get my money working for me. Needless to say - what and education it has been.

&#x200B;

Invested a modest 10k (apprx) between Aug & October in a mixture of INTC, GOOGL, AMZN, SQ, VZ, AMD, NFLX, PEGI, NVDA. I was quite pleased with earning about 5% by October but boy, what a time to start investing. Down over 3k from about 10k (down to about 6.9k now.)

&#x200B;

As a new investor, losing over a quarter of my investment in a few months with no end in sight is a bit of a shock.

&#x200B;

I'm assuming the advice at this point is ""Hang on. Keep investing"", but just want to hear the opinion of the masses. At this rate it's probably going to take me well over a year or two to regain what I've already lost.

&#x200B;

My reasonable, amateur inclination is to give it a little more time until there's an upward trend and invest another 10k over a few months to expedite the recovery. But I see other people on subs here suggesting they've sold the bulk of their positions and are waiting out the bear. Maybe that's the right strategy given the current circumstances? Should I consider moving a big chunk of my funds to some well-performing ETFs? Just don't have a lot of knowledge about those. Does it seem foolish to just hang on at this point, having invested at the peak of the bull, when it seems universally agreed we've still got a long way to fall?

NFLX Question,4,aflt1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/aflt1p/nflx_question/,16,1547431012.0,"Hi all!

I am wondering if NFLX is in for a very rough 2019. 

I like to use Buffett's style of investing -- i.e., if you use something (and you use it frequently etc), it is probably a good choice. 

Within the FANG group, I am currently typing on a Mac, I use Gmail and Google religiously, and Facebook is now everywhere in my life as well for advertising purposes (and has kind of replaced Yahoo as my go-to homepage for garbage news, a surprising success re: their adoption of the new feed). I am also a Netflix user. HOWEVER. 

I have to say that over the past few months, Netflix has begun to lose its luster for me. As I was browsing today, there was no longer anything interesting that caught my eye. They definitely have original content I will watch in the future (the next season of The Crown...?) but even those quality options (House of Cards) are seemingly dwindling. Netflix is increasingly an enormous mass of unwatchable or uninteresting content. 

Does anyone else feel similarly? I could see this seriously impacting their bottom line as we head out another year or two and more and more users begin feeling that Hulu / Amazon Prime have better value. Something else I have been reading is that NFLX quality is declining because noone will license their films / TV to them anymore -- so naturally they are banking on original content, but when your company becomes almost entirely filled with unwatchable original content... that becomes an enormous money waster.

FB, GOOG, AAPL are all smart enough to have developed multiple revenue streams -- I see regular criticism of FB re: more people using IG, and I want to bash my head into a table. But NFLX has not invested in horizontal expansion, instead, they have poured all their $ into themselves, which IMO may turn out to be a very dangerous move, and means they have much less resiliency than FB/GOOG/AAPL. 

Opinions? I do not own stock in NFLX but am considering a short position at some point. ",2019-01-14 09:56:52

What happens to Roku if Netflix beats expectations?,3,agygv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/agygv8/what_happens_to_roku_if_netflix_beats_expectations/,2,1547765349.0,"I'm interested in your opinions: how do you think Roku and Disney react if Netflix reports that they did well last quarter? Or conversely if Netflix tanks, how will other streaming company stocks react?

Does Netflix's rising tide lift all of the streaming boats? Or is it a signal that they're dominant and other streaming platforms will struggle to succeed with them around?

My personal opinion on Roku is that they just need to last for a few years. I think the streaming platform market is set to be very diluted in the next 3 years with new ones like Disney+ and every other network trying to make their own (and Apple?). Eventually some of them will pull the plug and settle in on a neutral streaming platform, like Roku. 

What are your opinions on the streaming game? Disney, Roku, Netflix, Amazon, (Apple?)? ",2019-01-18 06:49:09
"Netflix to stand, sell, or buy more prior to earnings?",1,agyvi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/agyvi2/netflix_to_stand_sell_or_buy_more_prior_to/,10,1547767843.0,"I added shares to my portfolio this morning. I see that many predict earnings to fall short which is why Netflix is adding to subscription fees. 

Am I the only one that actually thinks they are raising rates from a position of strength? Subscribers jumped, they beat earnings and thus now is the time to capitalize?

I’d love to hear thoughts?",2019-01-18 07:30:43

Netflix 'Earnings Interview' - Is this the 'earnings call'?,2,ah3w5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ah3w5m/netflix_earnings_interview_is_this_the_earnings/,1,1547795758.0,"I don't currently own Netflix, but have in past briefly. I never tuned in to any of their earnings calls. I'm watching this '[earnings interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYsKCfWV0fs&feature=youtu.be)' and it's just them sitting around talking to each other; no questions from analysts. I've never seen anything quite like this from a public company. Am I missing something? Do they not have a real analyst call each quarter? 

I always thought the point of an earnings call was to ensure fairness, so all players get access to info on the company at the same time.",2019-01-18 15:15:58
Netflix says it has 10% of all TV time in the US and discloses some colossal numbers for its shows,34,ahakbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ahakbb/netflix_says_it_has_10_of_all_tv_time_in_the_us/,38,1547847816.0,"KEY POINTS
-Netflix raised the veil on some of its viewership numbers for hits such as “Bird Box” in its fourth-quarter 2018 earnings letter.
-The numbers still give limited visibility into the content’s performance since it is only broken down by member households that watched, rather than individual viewers.
-Netflix said the technology created for its first interactive movie will be used for future projects as well.
