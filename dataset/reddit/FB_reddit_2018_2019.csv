Lost a chunk of change. I'm just trying to make sure my by with FB isn't biased as it was back then with BBRY.

**- BBRY h**ad a healthy balance sheet, although they had APPLE and then android as new competitors to the smartphone market. BBRY was a dominant position in smart phone market. Rest is history they tanked.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/FGCngSy6/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/FGCngSy6/)

I took long position on FB after the recent drop after earnings. Got in at 177, flipped it at 185. Re-established position at 180.

**- FB** has a healthy balance sheet. No new competitors to social media space. Dominant position in social media space. They tanked because guidance for future was negative, due to increased spending, not necessarily tied to revenue generation.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/xmlr4Q56/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/xmlr4Q56/)

Belief

* I believe FB is different from BBRY because I believe this drop is more of a investor over reaction versus a fundamental change to the social media advertising space.
* The reaction is due to the guidance that fb will be spending more money, not necessarily earning less.
* No new players to the market place, unless advertisers are moving towards twitter instead of facebook or instagram. Google still has a play in the advertising space, that is competitive with facebook. Are there new players?
* If consumers are spending less due to lack of disposable income, would advertisers spend more to try and get more customers? OR would advertisers spend less because they're aware they have a decrease in sales due to poor market conditions, so they'd save their advertising budget for a healthier economy?

Before Q2 earnings I got all hyped up about FB and bought 5 shares @ $216.

The stock crashed to 200 immediately. Thinking I'm smart that I didn't invest ""a lot"", I bought 5 more @ $201. And then the stock made one of the greatest plunges in history. 
Determined that this was the time it stabilizes, I bought in 7 shares @ 176.

So now I have 17 shares @194.78 and the stock keeps falling. I'm -$610 (18%) as of today.


So far I've already put $3311 which represents a good chunk of my investments (~$15k).

My cumulative portfolio growth including the 600 dollar loss is +28% (~$3.5k)


Do you guys advice me putting in more money @158 (~2k) to average my cost to about $180?

Its a shame to say that I am down \~16% all time (starting from August, 2017), especially in the bull market that has been going for quite some time. It wasn't always like this--for a majority of the time that I've been investing I've had pretty solid returns. I made some investments that I now regret (specifically MU @52), and being in college now, I have been almost too busy to keep up with my portfolio. I am now at a point where I've suffered through some pretty tough losses and I am not sure what steps to take going forward. I don't know whether to sell for a loss, or hold longer term and break even (hopefully).

**My current portfolio consists of the following:**

* MU-32.41% of portfolio (down 32%)
* MSFT-33.26% of portfolio (up 6%)
* FB-13.83% of portfolio (down 18%)
* AAPL-13.63% of portfolio (up 16%)
* SGMO-6.87% of portfolio (down 26%)

As you can see, I've made some questionable decisions. My rationale for my losers was I believed MU was undervalued in its industry (before the China tariffs and other bad news) based on various factors, I thought that FB would bounce after the unpleasant earnings report in August, and I have followed SGMO for quite awhile and have confidence in what they do although they haven't had great news recently. I have been stubborn with not selling for a loss but I can't sit and hopelessly watch some of my holdings continue to fall. Hindsight is 20/20, had I known to buy more AAPL or MSFT I would've but I can't change that. I want to transition into some ETFs (SPY, QQQ, VTI, etc.) in order to limit my exposure to volatility and risk. As I mentioned, I am wondering whether to sell out of some of my positions or keep holding. I will  then change into less risky holdings. Thank you!

**tl;dr:** Made bad investment decisions with some stocks; have not been tracking my holdings as frequently as I should have lately. Need to know whether I should hold or sell for a hefty loss. Current holdings listed above.

Why do people feel so comfortable holding FB long-term?,246,9tb027,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9tb027/why_do_people_feel_so_comfortable_holding_fb/,198,1541118696.0,"More than willing to accept I'm wrong on this, and if it isn't obvious, I am pretty biased against FB because I personally hate the company, but I'd like to keep this discussion objective.

I don't see how people think Facebook will stay relevant long-term.

Other big tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have an established product/service that would be very hard to recreate. Its unlikely that a college kid could re-invent the Google Search algorithm/write a phone OS like android. Or set up a massive logistics infrastructure like Amazon has. Or make a similar product to Windows or Azure.

Facebook, on the other hand, is a fancy, glorified web forum. There are probably thousands of clones that would work the same or better if all Facebook users migrated over. Why is everyone on Facebook? For most people, the answer is simply ""because everyone else is"". They were the first ""grown-up"" social media site, and that's why they ended up with all the users. 

So what do they bring to the table? A clunky forum-like service. Its true value is the userbase, and they would be nothing without it. If I presented an objectively better version of facebook that cared about your privacy and had no ads called myfriendpals.com and said you should switch over, would you? No because all your friends and family are on Facebook. I wouldn't switch over either.

Now you'd think Facebook would try to treat their users well to encourage them to stay for a long time, but they are constantly in the news being caught fucking them over one way or another to squeeze every bit of possible short-term profit out. The platform is so full of ads and spam that the content you actually logged on to see is buried. Facebook has stopped caring about pleasing its userbase. Its working out for them now, but will it always? I've never met a Facebook fanboy. Everyone uses it because they ""have to"".

If a new platform actually finds a way to get a chunk of Facebook users to bother switching over, it will snowball and people will start leaving Facebook at an exponential rate.

I know they have bought out other popular companies, and facebook.com isn't their only source of revenue, but same deal with Instagram. Its a simple platform that doesn't really bring much to the table except the other users which could leave at any time.

What are your thoughts?",2018-11-02 08:31:36
The Dips I'm Buying This Week,36,9wkq3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9wkq3x/the_dips_im_buying_this_week/,60,1542103450.0,"Hello! This is my tentative list: AAPL, NVDA, FB, ATVI, & TTWO.

An argument for Facebook (FB),25,9wrb3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9wrb3l/an_argument_for_facebook_fb/,34,1542160360.0,"There has been a lot of pessimism surrounding the tech industry recently and I truly believe these claims are overblown.

Much of the heat has fallen on the once darling tech company, Facebook, which has fallen over 25% from its ATH.  This correction, while justified, is also extremely exacerbated by the overwhelming (and often redundant) amount of negative news against the social media giant.  Here are my arguments for why Facebook is currently trading at a bargain and why that bargain won't last.

&#x200B;

* ""Senator, we make ads."" Despite your personal gripes with Zuckerburg, there is no denying that this is a man who knows what his company does and more importantly, how his company makes money.  Sure, there have been executives leaving Facebook for artistic choices regarding monetization over the social experience, but as investors, the push for monetization is exactly why this company is a screaming buy.  Facebook and Google combined account for the vast majority of advertising profits.  Though many people loosely throw around the phrase ""printing money"", Facebook seems to be the only company that is quite literally doing that.

&#x200B;

* ""Data is king.""  If data is king, then Facebook is the hard drive.  It is 100% true, the market for Facebook is saturated.  USER GROWTH IS SLOWING.   That makes sense when you're reaching over 2 billion DAUs.  The argument that the company is worth less because user growth is slowing is not just incorrect, but completely foolish and exactly the reason why this company is severely discounted.  Facebook literally has data on almost every single person on the face of this earth.  Yes, they are going to have data breaches.  No company has ever reached the scale in data that Facebook currently commands.  With that comes new challenges that I believe Facebook is actually handling extremely well.

&#x200B;

* Multiple revenue streams is an overlooked given.  I don't want to dwell on this point too much as it will be discussed in a future bullet point.  But Facebook is a titan because it is not a one trick pony.  Long gone are the days of ""Facebook, the social media company.""  Facebook is a conglomerate.  They own subsidiaries that bring in cash and have dormant segments that have yet to be monetized.  The prime examples that come to mind are WhatsApp and Instagram which is currently in its infancy in terms of monetization.

&#x200B;

* Implicit redundancy of users.  Imagine this, 7.53 billion people on the face of this earth, but 10 billion+ using Facebook or a Facebook subsidiary every day.  How is this possible?  Implicit redundancy.  I log into facebook, browse it for a few minutes and get bored before hopping onto IG.  A message pops up on my phone using my Whatsapp messenger.  3 hits, one person.  When, NOT IF, Facebook monetizes these platforms to their fullest capacity (without compromising performance), they will literally be catering to an impossibly large market.  The largest the world has ever seen.

&#x200B;

* Tech Growth and Diversification.  Everything can pretty much be wrapped into here and I'm going to do just that.  The tech sector is slowing down.  But at the same time, its vamping back up.  Facebook is just beginning to dabble in VR and AI.  Personally, I believe AI is the future and VR is an auxiliary function.  But regardless of what I think, they have their hands in the future.  Their diversification feeds back to the idea of them having multiple streams of revenue.  Data they get from one platform can be leveraged to increase the performance of their AI or other sister platforms.  Facebook is becoming a symbiotic being and when AI is fully developed and integrated into a system that ties all their platforms together.  Well, that's Skynet for you.

Honestly, writing this out makes me even more excited for this company.  It is trading lower than I thought it would be trading and I have put my money where my mouth is and have been buying religiously at these levels.  When you invest in Facebook, have no doubt, you are investing in the future.  I do not want to put a monetary value on where the stock will be in a few months or in a year.  But I will tell you that an investment in this company WILL pay off.  In 10 years, Facebook will be around and more prevalent than ever, even if it has a different name.  My investment thesis is still in tact and the fundamentals of this company are as strong as ever.  Facebook long.",2018-11-14 09:52:40

Why I think $FB will buy $SPOT soon.,17,9xgdi3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9xgdi3/why_i_think_fb_will_buy_spot_soon/,27,1542352206.0,"Looking at FB, it is currently sitting on a boatload of cash. Looking at SPOT, it is right now reasonably priced at $25B and losing cash.


With FB's margins, they are able to eat SPOT's current losses and ensure Spotify's mission of capturing market share. 

Also, the sentiment around FB has been pretty ugly. They have only been in the news when they're being attacked for their use of consumer data. I think an acquisition at this level could reverse sentiment as it would signify FB's aggressive approach to future acquisitions and an attempt to diversify their offering.

GOOG, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, FB are all focused right now on one thing - capturing and retaining consumer's attention. I could see Spotify become an arm for content creation for FB: music, audiobooks, podcasts, news - you name it. Spotify has the clean UI and subscription business model to be a one stop shop for those media.

I also think SPOT is a fantastic fit into FB's overall suite, and would fuel their mission of uniting the world. Heck, music is the world's language.

Is FANG maxed out? The most promising technologies of the next decade (2020 and beyond) and which companies to invest in?,230,a0axqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/a0axqy/is_fang_maxed_out_the_most_promising_technologies/,118,1543199474.0,"During a bear market, tech and other growth companies are generally the ones that experience the biggest corrections in share prices due to poor fundamentals and high P/E ratios. However, it doesn't change the fact that investing in general is always about future value. Obviously 'future' is subjective and will vary from person to person, as some people are looking to invest for 5 years while others are looking to set-and-forget for 20+ years, but the point is - people are essentially making a long-term bet that the company will evolve into a stronger leader in its respective industry.

FANG (Facebook ($FB), Amazon ($AMZN), Netflix ($NFLX), and Alphabet ($GOOG)) have been the 4 powerhouse tech stocks that consistently beat the market. As of August 10, 2017 — while the NASDAQ 100 was up 19 percent and the S&P 500 was up 8.9 percent year-to-date (YTD) — FANGs were up more than 2x that of the latter. Year-to-date, Facebook (FB) was up 45 percent, Amazon (AMZN) 27 percent, Netflix (NFLX) 36 percent and Alphabet’s Google (GOOG) 16 percent, beating the returns of both indices. (Source: Yahoo Finance)

As we reach the peak of the 'tech bubble', people have questioned whether the year-over-year growth for FANG is sustainable, while others added to their bullish sentiment with the inclusion of other industry leaders -- In Sept. 2018, CNBC published an article that said that Square ($SQ) should be part of the FANG group based on the hyper-bullish sentiment of a Nomura Instinet analyst, who also set a massive price target of $125 per share.

October 2018 - The Motley Fool came out with an article ([https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/09/forget-fang-stocks-meet-mana.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/09/forget-fang-stocks-meet-mana.aspx)) titled \*Forget FANG Stocks: Meet MANA\* (Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple ($AAPL), Netflix ($NFLX), Amazon ($AMZN))

Q3 ERs for most tech companies were disasters - most beat Q2 expectations, but they slipped on the Q4 guidance. Whether you believe that they are sandbagging is up to you, but people hoped that strong ER and Q4 guidance from FANG/FANGS/FAANG/MANA was going to prop up the market from further slide -- they didn't. If I recall correctly, Netflix was the one that had the strongest ER and jumped nearly 13% in the after hours. Apple bombed on their iPhone sales and announced that going forward, they would no longer be reporting iPhone sales unit numbers. People started to question whether FANG had enough innovation left in their tanks to continue to grow and drive expansion.

\*\*So what's next?\*\* There are a number of advancements that are on the verge of a major breakthrough and adoption:

\* Robotics/AI

\* 5G

\* Quantum computing

\* Internet of Things (IoT)

\* Blockchain (this does not necessarily mean cryptocurrencies)

\* Gene editing/modification

\* Healthcare/Biotech/Pharmaceuticals

What technologies are you bullish on for the future? Which companies are you investing for said tech?

Buying Opportunity,8,a8bwff,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/a8bwff/buying_opportunity/,38,1545440182.0,"There’s a lot of deals out there if you can stomach it, folks.  The economic indicators are very well intact so if you’re long, I would think twice about selling. 

I left the market around 2,800 as I thought we were a bit inflated.  I just bought leap calls yesterday in sectors I think are a little too low. 

AAPL - -40%+- Every time there’s a bad quarter, analysts say “it’s just a phone company”.  Meanwhile, their cash reserves are greater than many sovereign nations. 

NFLX - -40%+- This is a bit of a risky play as they were super high to begin with, and with Disney’s upcoming service, they may take a hit.  Still, I think they’ll be around for a while. 

UPRO - -50%+- 3X ETF for SPY.  This is self explanatory.  Barring a recession which is unlikely, the market should rebound within the next 6-12 months. 

JNUG - -60%+- 3X ETF for gold miners.  Relatively safe play if the economy continues to crap itself.  And, decent volatility to boot. 

USO- -45%+- Oil. Same as JNUG, relatively safe play. 

JNJ- -15+- This company is just solid for any portfolio. 

GE- A LOT+- This is a fairly risky play but I’m banking on the fact they get their act together in 2019.  However, titans fall from time to time. Just look at Sears, though I’d say this is much different than retail. 

FB- -45%+- I’ve always disliked this company based on their subscriber rates being close to full attrition for years now.  However, based on the scandals and market correction, they’ve taken a beating.  People forget they print cash. 

AMZN- -30%+- It’s amzn, what else needs to be said?  The only issue they face is government regulation and that has yet to be acknowledged so they’ll continue to be a juggernaut.  If you look back to 2016 and bought leap calls in February for a mere $10,000 investment, it could’ve netted 2.2 million dollars.  

SQQQ- And here’s the safety net. Should everything fail before expiry, this etf will provide an equal balance sheet, at least.  This is risky as it’s affected by interest rates and contango but if you keep an eye on it, you should be fine.  Short term only or you’ll get eaten alive.  For the more risk centric investors, VXX.  However, you’ll need balls of steel. 

I’m not advising anyone to do anything, I’m just sharing what I started scaling into yesterday.  Before you panic, understand that the market always goes up over time because it has to, based on our economic model.  YoY we’re down roughly 8% and if we hit 2,400, we’ll be down 22% from ATHs just a couple of months ago.  These type of drops don’t happen very often during a spurring economy so do your research and understand the cycles.  

I could be wrong but if I am, we’re going into to a recession anyway.  And if that’s true, I’ll just keep averaging down.  All of my positions are over 2y expirys (except the 3x-6mo) so there’s time. 

Note* the percentages are based of memory, please cut me some slack if I’m a few points off.

Happy Saturday to all of you.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 24th, 2018.

# **Stocks enter final full week of the year on the brink of a bear market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/21/stocks-on-brink-of-bear-market-.html)**
*****
> Stocks head into the final full trading week of the year on the brink of a bear market.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted in the past week in its worst performance since before the bull market began, in the very thick of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008.
*****
> While the market is seemingly oversold, strategists see little chance for any bounce in the week ahead, and the focus will remain on Washington's fight over a government shutdown. Strategists say it may be too soon for investors to look for bargains among the rubble in what has traditionally been one of the quietest weeks of the year.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite Index, dragged down by tech and biotech, was the first index to close in bear market territory, and is now 22 percent from its high. The Nasdaq lost 8.4 percent to 6,332 in the past week.
*****
> The Dow fell 6.9 percent in the past week, to 22,445, and is now just 3 percentage points away from bear market territory, or a 20 percent decline. The S&P 500 was down 7 percent for the week and is just 16 points away from a key support level of 2,400. It is also just about 2 percentage points from a bear market.
*****
> ""Even if we do [get a Santa rally], it's not going to be meaningful. It's going to be super light volume, with a half trading day,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. ""Normally, this has been one of the strongest months of the year, but so far things in 2018 that normally have happened haven't been happening.""
*****
> In a bad sign on Friday, volume was really heavy. More than 12 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Friday, the biggest volume in at least two years.
*****
> The stock market closes after a half day on Monday, Christmas Eve, and is closed Tuesday.
*****
> **Dismal December**

> December's performance is nearly the worst on record for the month, with the Dow's decline of 12 percent the worst since 1931. December is typically a good time of year for stocks, and this December is on track to be the worst month of the year for the first time ever.
*****
> ""I would imagine trading activity is going to slow down quite a bit,"" said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""Overall, I think the focus is going to be on getting things tied up ahead of year's end. It's possible there could be some outsized moves given reduced liquidity. I think there's going to be a lot of focus on getting a fresh start next year.""
*****
> Technical analysts say the market continues to look weak, with many stocks in bear market territory already and trading well below their 200-day moving averages.
*****
> The S&P 500 had been in a range from 2,600 to 2,800 for four months, but quickly fell out of it all the way to 2,400.
*****
> ""The measured move was reached faster and more furious than most people thought,"" said Scott Redler of T3Live.com. ""It doesn't seem like anyone wants to step in the way of the headlines that are piling up. And why would they? The next level traders would like to see tested is 2,250 to 2,300.""
*****
> A negative chart formation that emerged last week, known as a head-and-shoulders formation, points to a level of 2,300 in the S&P 500.
*****
> ""Buyers are just sitting back and instead of playing an oversold bounce, they're just waiting,"" he said. ""Anybody's that tried to position for a Santa rally has been absolutely run over. The calendar issues have been all off.""
*****
> **Government shutdown**

> Hanging over the market in the week ahead are the government shutdown fight, which pits the president against Democrats in Congress, over his plan for a border wall. There was a glimmer of hope late on Friday that a deal could be hatched, with Sen. Bob Corker saying a path forward was being discussed.
*****
> While traders said there was not much concern about the partial shutdown, a bigger worry was the fighting that could become the norm once Democrats have control of the House in January.
*****
> ""It does seem like it's weighing on sentiment. It's more a signal about just how difficult things will ultimately be. It enhances expectations for gridlock in the future,"" said Cabana.
*****
> The Fed this past week was viewed as a major catalyst for the sell-off, after it released a forecast for more rate hikes at the same time it sees a slower growing economy.
*****
> That sparked concerns that the Fed was heading for a policy mistake, and comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that the Fed's balance sheet rolldown was on ""autopilot"" really spooked traders.
*****
> But on Friday, New York Fed President John Williams kicked off a brief stock market rally when he told CNBC the Fed is willing to reconsider its policy depending on the economy and conditions. His comment was not unlike Powell's, but traders said he sounded more flexible and sensitive to market conditions.
*****
> Strategists point to a few big concerns for the markets heading into next year — the most worrisome being trade and the Fed.
*****
> Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley said his base case is there will be a trade agreement with China that avoids the next round of tariffs.
*****
> ""The tariffs so far don't have much impact on the economy,"" he said. ""If we moved into 2019 and all tariffs were implemented, that would very quickly outweigh all stimulus we have coming into 2019. That would be a weight on GDP growth and bring our numbers down for next year.""
*****
> Cabana said growth for the beginning of the year looks good, and if sentiment could stabilize that might help markets. Treasury yields fell in the past week, with the 10-year yield at 2.78 percent Friday.
*****
> ""We think rates could be higher. We think 3 percent is reasonable ... but quite honestly risks appear quite heavily to the downside,"" he said. ""The bigger ones are international and geopolitical in nature — what happens to trade, China's economy, Brexit, European populism and gridlock in the U.S.""
*****
> Cabana said the low end of the range for the 10-year yield could be 2.5 percent.

# Average S&P 500 Stock Decline Exceeds 25%

> The S&P 500 may not have reached bear market territory as an index yet, but of the 500 individual stocks in the index, more than 60% are down at least 20% from their 52-week highs. Overall, the average decline from a 52-week high is a staggering 25.7%! The chart below shows the distance each of the individual components is trading from their 52-week highs grouped by 10 percentage point ranges. As of Thursday afternoon, just 72 stocks in the S&P 500 are even trading within 10% of their 52-week highs. Meanwhile, 82 stocks in the index are down 40% or more with 24 of those 82 stocks down by more than half! Have their been uglier periods for the stock market? You bet. But not in a long time.

> So which stocks are down the most? There are actually a number of well-known names with stocks like General Electric (GE), Western Digital (WDC), Nvidia (NVDA), Halliburton (HAL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Micron (MU), and Applied Materials (AMAT) all having been more than cut in half.

# Is It Time For Santa?

> So far it’s been rough for stocks in December, a month that has historically been bullish. How bad has it been? After 10 trading days, we’re off to the worst start to December since 1980! In fact, the S&P 500 Index is flirting with “worst month of 2018” status, currently held by October (-6.9%). Since 1957, when the S&P 500 started in its current form of roughly 500 stocks, December has never been the worst month of the year.

> Is there still time for a Santa Claus rally? “December has been a month to forget for equities so far, but there is a silver lining. Turns out, the majority of December’s gains tend to happen the second half of the month—so we still have time to believe in Santa,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, December is historically a strong month that has tended to see the majority of its gains late in the month.

# Day Before Christmas: Tech and Small-Caps Best

> For decades we have been tracking the market’s performance around holidays in the annual Stock Trader’s Almanac. In the 52nd edition for 2019, data for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 can be found on page 88. Of the eight holidays tracked, Christmas has been one of the most consistently bullish with respectable average gains occurring on the day before. Small-caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have been up 74.2% of the time on the day before Christmas with an average gain of 0.37% since 1987. NASDAQ is second best, up 67.7% of the time with an average gain of 0.42%. DJIA and S&P 500 have been softer with gains 61.3% and 58.1% of the time respectively. Volatility also tends to be subdued ahead of Christmas as well as the worst decline recorded by any of the four indexes was 0.69% by NASDAQ in 1997. NASDAQ also had the best day before performance, up a staggering 7.56% in 2000. The market did not get exactly what it was looking for from the Fed, but perhaps a pause in trading, to celebrate Christmas, will have some positive impact.

Its apparent that the market has gotten ridiculously SPOILT due to the extreme growth in 2017 and 2018.

Everyone should just calm down. The economic numbers DO NOT indicate a recession, but a slowdown. ( not that it would help in reducing the fear in the markets) 

Edit: this is my research and my 2cents. Everyone should do their own research and make up your own mind on what you want to do. 

Apparently there are some people who think i am trying to ‘ sway’ their decisions or call bullshit without any civilized evidence to back it up and just throw negative comments. 

You guys can panic sell or whatever, no one gives a shit. And stop being salty. 

Your 4 shares in your RB account is not even gonna make a ripple in this market so calm down with the negative rhetoric.  

Do your own research, i shared mine with a valid article to back it up. And that is what this forum is about.

I am bullish on Netflix and Amazon and
bearish on FB and Apple. First three are not trade war stock still they are not fully immune. 
Important thing to look next week is the meeting netween US and  China.
If meeting goes good (less chance) buy long call DTE march 1 for amazon and Netflix.
If meeting goes bad buy more apple put Feb 15 DTE

Other Important points:
Border wall shutdown: No solution within next week. When it is solved stock will temporarily go up.   (+)
China trade war and slowing economy: Most probably will not change until trump gone. Trumps position is weakening and china will exploit that to buy time. But trump will not risk economy by imposing more tax. What they gonna do is to make a face saving deal and keep things like it for now. (+)
Feds became dovish (+)


Within next 3 months general stocks remain same or move up. Don't go down much. 
In this earning cycle (Q1) all tech and china stock report bad earning most likely.  

Possible things on the table: 
Trump impeachment: New government will be stable and china trade war will stop. That is positive. If trump is impeached (he will not be) than it will be problem as violence and unrest may result. If he lost 2020 election (which he will) it is good for stock market in a long run. 

Current turbulent state will run through 2020 with stock loosing or not increasing much. After that we may se bull run again.

People have to invest in a particular brand app store will make the products very sticky. ( Not going to buy a HTC Shadow 2 over an Oculus Quest 2, when the Oculus Quest 2 can play my $1000+ Oculus Quest 1 library,  and the Shadow can't)

The price of HMDs will make it unlikely that most  people will purchase more than one

There should be a limited amount of platforms that recieve developer attention, based on the number of users on the platforms. Both the number and quality of apps will fall into a liminted number of ecosystems at best.

Will limit the amount of app stores that can be successful, much like the smart phone, or gaming console market today. I see little competition for FB outside of Sony (and Sony competes only in the demographic that has Playstations) in near term VR. I don't see Valve as a serious long term competitor, but if they are it will be in high end PC VR, which is a small niche market. I see VR developing into a market with very little competition amongst a few app ecosystems. 

Facebook/Oculus is years ahead on research over the competition, creating better products, at cheaper prices, and with better marketing. This will allow them to capture market share, and lock consumers in early on. Margins in this business will be sustainably high, as evident in Android or Apple app stores. VR will be a high growth market for years to come, and FB also has strong chances to become a major player in AR. ",2019-01-06 19:46:29

NFLX Question,3,aflt1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/aflt1p/nflx_question/,16,1547431012.0,"Hi all!

I am wondering if NFLX is in for a very rough 2019. 

I like to use Buffett's style of investing -- i.e., if you use something (and you use it frequently etc), it is probably a good choice. 

Within the FANG group, I am currently typing on a Mac, I use Gmail and Google religiously, and Facebook is now everywhere in my life as well for advertising purposes (and has kind of replaced Yahoo as my go-to homepage for garbage news, a surprising success re: their adoption of the new feed). I am also a Netflix user. HOWEVER. 

I have to say that over the past few months, Netflix has begun to lose its luster for me. As I was browsing today, there was no longer anything interesting that caught my eye. They definitely have original content I will watch in the future (the next season of The Crown...?) but even those quality options (House of Cards) are seemingly dwindling. Netflix is increasingly an enormous mass of unwatchable or uninteresting content. 

Does anyone else feel similarly? I could see this seriously impacting their bottom line as we head out another year or two and more and more users begin feeling that Hulu / Amazon Prime have better value. Something else I have been reading is that NFLX quality is declining because noone will license their films / TV to them anymore -- so naturally they are banking on original content, but when your company becomes almost entirely filled with unwatchable original content... that becomes an enormous money waster.

FB, GOOG, AAPL are all smart enough to have developed multiple revenue streams -- I see regular criticism of FB re: more people using IG, and I want to bash my head into a table. But NFLX has not invested in horizontal expansion, instead, they have poured all their $ into themselves, which IMO may turn out to be a very dangerous move, and means they have much less resiliency than FB/GOOG/AAPL. 

Opinions? I do not own stock in NFLX but am considering a short position at some point. ",2019-01-14 09:56:52

Which of your positions are you adding to ahead of earnings and which are you waiting until after?,3,air64t,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/air64t/which_of_your_positions_are_you_adding_to_ahead/,6,1548218262.0,"We all have our favourites but the market has been a bit shaky recently so I’m wondering which of your holdings you consider a steal now and in good shape heading into earnings, and which you like but want to wait until after to see how it shakes out.

For me, I’m thinking of upping my Apple, FB and Norwegian Cruiselines. I’m unsure about the rest so I might leave them until after.",2019-01-23 12:37:42
My parents want me to invest in 20k for them. Which ones do you think is best?,1,aj2yzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/aj2yzg/my_parents_want_me_to_invest_in_20k_for_them/,71,1548298077.0,"So my parents want me to invest 20k cash (no margin) into some stocks they think will grow. They want something that can be profitable within 1 year.

I'm thinking of either AMD or weed stocks. Reason is because they have room to grow but also since there is no margin investment, there is no need to worry if they drop or rise.

&#x200B;

The other is like 100 apple shares or fb shares, and sell when it reaches a high again, since they are at a low price now. A lot more stable and less risk imo.

&#x200B;

They wanted penny stocks, and I told them that was a bad idea. They want basically instant gratifcation which I explained is not gonna happen.

&#x200B;

Reason why they want me to do this, is because my dad screwed up royally ""trading"". He basically obsesses over charts daily and he believes he can predict future trends. Then he panic sells. He is kinda a gambler. He already lost a lot of money until I told him to chill and hold onto whatever he had until the stock rises again, since drops and corrections are normal. The minute a stock goes down, he freaks and says they are gonna go bankrupt, then he sells and loses money lol. This was with cash account... like he wasn't even on margin and he was ripping his hair out.

Any suggestions?

There are also etfs...

&#x200B;

I'm just looking for something stable and profitable. I could care less about their unrealsitic demands lol",2019-01-24 10:47:57
