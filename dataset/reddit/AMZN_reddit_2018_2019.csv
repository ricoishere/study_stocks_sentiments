Thoughts about Amazon’s PE,4,84cbxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/84cbxr/thoughts_about_amazons_pe/,21,1521051995.0,"Hello there,


I started investing recently and go long only, hence try to choose those securities that have a potential over the next 30-40 years ideally.

I have noticed on this sub that many people are quite sceptical about Amazon and their PE of 200+.

However, I have looked at their report (Dec 2016 is the most recent one) and I thought it would be wise to also consider their net capital growth in addition to net income.

Example:

In 2016 their net income was $2.37bn, which constituted to $5.01 per share (hence the PE).

However, they also got a net capital gain of about $17bn ($20bn assets -$3bn liabilities).

In my view, that is another $17bn of ‘real’ income, which is 7 times more than the net income figure.

Therefore, would that be fair to say that the PE (capital gain adjusted) would then be 7 times less, hence circa 30? Not theoretically of course but as a common sense fact - that $17bn capital growth should not go unnoticed.

Hence my point that Amazon is a great long investment.

Thanks for your opinions.

I got around $50,000 I wont mind ""throwing"" over Amazon for the next few years, and I really think amazon could pull of atleast %15 annual returns, which might make the $50K to $141K, a pretty nice change, I will be in college at that time and wont need the money. Of course there is a chance of losing it, but as I already said I dont mind losing those $50,000 for a chance of making $141K in the course of my studies. Also, there is always the option amazon could magically go %20 or even %30 annualy which will make it $400K, It is very unlikely but I do trust miracles. 

I was thinking about making another investment for a really long time (around 20-30 years), on NVDA , MSFT , and maybe TSLA. 
What do you guys think? Nvidia will most likely explode since graphics increase all the time and the chance of losing is pretty small in my idea, even %3 annual can make $50K to $122K, and thats only with %3 annual intrest, which I predict is going to be around %6-%10 for NVDA.

Which is about a 1000% increase compared to last year eps. So yes, amzn's earnings will have a giant raise in the comming years. At current price levels they will have an forcasted PE ratio of 23 in 2021!!! 

How can amzn grow it's eps with 1000% in 4 years? And even if they can manage to grow that hard, it will still be very expensive in 2021.

Opinions on why AMZN is stagnant,0,8gmuim,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/8gmuim/opinions_on_why_amzn_is_stagnant/,8,1525341388.0,"Just curious on your opinions on AMZN after the quarter and where it's heading. A brief summary of my research is below.

TLDR: Slowing GDP, increasing bond yield, concerns of decreasing consumer spending, and May selling led to stagnant stock price. There is good news but higher than usual amazon stock volitility makes me think that the market doesn't know how to react. Overall trend will be upwards after S&P 500 stocks contacting.

I'm trying to figure out why Amazon is rather stagnant after a great quarter. So from my understanding thus far, revenues were up tremendously, leading to a ~7% hike in stock price, however, half of that was lost by the end of the day. I'm assuming this was mainly due to slowing GDP, and concerns of decreasing consumer spending. Others investors pretty much think that amazon is overvalued. More factors put into play are: increasing bond yield, increasing FED interest rates, increasing unemployment rate. (There's definitely more that I'm missing, but I think these are the major factors)

But if we take a look on the other spectrum, we see Amazon raising the price of Prime and Prime retention, rapid growth in their AWS business, and a majority of analyst mark it as a buy.

I personally think it's currently a battle between US market correction vs stock performance pricing. So relative to the market (tracking by S&P 500), AMZN is doing well but stock price is decreasing because the whole market is contracting. So once the market contractions end, AMZN price should increase, but the question now becomes how long will the contraction last, and will there be a recession? A thing of interest I've noticed are larger fluctuations in AMZN stock price sometimes from roughly -1.5% to +1.5% and vice versa. I think for a stock at this price, it's highly unusual that the stock price is this volatile so the market is uncertain of how to react.

This is my personal opinion and feel free to leave your opinions.

$UPS - Buying Opportunity,4,8um57h,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/8um57h/ups_buying_opportunity/,13,1530239578.0,"I understand for UPS that losing AMZN as a customer stinks. But they make ~$68Billion in revenue, and the AMZN Shipments make up only about $1B of their revenue. I know $1B is a lot of money to lose, but it only makes up 1.5% of UPS revenue. 


The next point is that AMZN will only be handling their own shipments through these ""independent"" comapnies... so these claims that ""AMZN is going after UPS, FDX, Etc."" are off base. There is a lot of panic selling going on right now. and this is actually good for potential investors in my opinion which is going to lead into my next point....


Not to be corny but ""Winter is coming"". Ok yes that was corny, but the point is still valid. What do we all know about delivery companies? Their best quarter is the 4th quarter of every year. Christmas...Black Friday immediately come to mind. These companies always have strong revenues at the end of the year....and with a lot of panic selling going on right now there is definitely a good chance to get in early when people start to realize that AMZN doesn't make up a large portion of UPS profits. 

How far will they fall? This I cannot answer for you. My best advice here is to wait for resistances and right now there are none at the moment.  

What if you don't like UPS? FDX is also down significantly. They are also looking attractive right now with these threats of AMZN dominating the delivery market.


I don't usually do posts like this, a friend of mine asked me for me insight on to when I pull the trigger on investments and then said I should share with others too... so here's me sharing! I love good companies that get unfairly beat up, and this definitely is something I usually pull the trigger on (I will definitely add some to my position in the near future).

Full Disclosure: I do own shares in UPS and plan to purchase more. I plan to hold longer than 12 months.

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DicAwRmVsAAd97J.jpg

This chart shows that the five largest S&P 500 stocks have a market capitalization equal to the bottom 282 S&P 500 stocks. This turned out to be something of a Rorschach test, which was not my intention. I just thought it was a powerful visual. I wasn’t really trying to make a point, certainly not the point that many thought I was going for.

The reason I made that chart was because I was working on this post today, which will  attempt to show that there are plenty of other stocks outside of FAANG that are doing just fine. That tweet had the opposite effect. Hopefully this will remedy that.

The chart below shows the average returns of S&P 500 stocks year-to-date broken down by market cap decile. The first decile is the 50 largest stocks, the second decile is the next 50 largest stocks, and so on. You can plainly see that while the mega caps are performing well, and powering the index higher, there are other stocks that are doing just fine. The 4th, 6th, and 7th deciles are performing better than the 2nd and 3rd.

It is pretty wild to think that the five largest stocks are as large as the bottom 282 S&P 500 stocks, but the truth is, this is how a cap weighted index works. Yum! Brands can triple and it still would not move the needle of the index as much as if Apple gains 1%.

We are not in uncharted territory. The Pareto Principle is a feature of financial markets, not a bug.

Do you think the largest S&P 500 stocks will continue to be equally big and dominant, in market cap, in the future?",2018-07-21 11:57:49

My theory on the recent FANG declines.,0,92jvj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/92jvj7/my_theory_on_the_recent_fang_declines/,6,1532785509.0,"My theory:
Given the decline we are seeing in FANG stocks, I think the value of user data for the purposes of targeted adverting isn't yielding what it once did, and a lot of these FANG companies deal largely in ad targeting / user data (significantly, Facebook and Twitter). I've speculated for some time now that companies are going lower budget on advertising, which could be a signal that people are not spending as much as they once did (i.e. ""less effective advertising"" ).It wasn't long ago that the market caught on to the idea that gathering large amounts of data could be used to target/dictate consumer spending, and I think a decline in this sector indicates the market is beginning to realize it has overreached. The effectiveness of ad targeting from user data is clearly seen in the unprecedented rise of the FANG stocks over the years....in fact, I think it has been so effective that the average consumer is now unable to spend or use credit like they once could before they had been targeted with ads.

Google struck gold on a search engine, but maybe the mine has officially run out of ore. If people can't afford the products/services offered through advertisements, they simply can't buy the product. The ads would be deemed less effective, and companies would be inclined to spend less on it. The FANG execs would see the writing on the wall when their earnings have declined......That could be quite the incentive to dump stock before the quarter ends. Just saying.

Would you call it an advertising bubble?

*LENGTHY POST* Intentionally NOT diversifying?,1,95ylnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/95ylnt/lengthy_post_intentionally_not_diversifying/,11,1533865148.0,"
Good afternoon!!

I would consider myself to be a moderately experienced investor, however, I do seek out opinions and advice on topics that I struggle finding more information on. I would also consider my risk-tolerance to be slightly high, but not extreme.

When I started my portfolio years ago as a novice, I invested only in Tesla. I made good money quickly. I never locked in my gains. The stock became wildly volatile, and I went negative, and then back up some, and then down again, and I ended up selling for a profit, but nowhere near the highs that I had previously held it at.

I learned from that experience, and I diversified up to about 25 holdings in various sectors. I didn't have any major profits, but I hardly ever had any real losses, unless the market was down overall. After around 6 months or so, I was very much able to differentiate the quality of performance between my holdings. I sold my laggards and used the funds to acquire more shares in my top performers. I condensed my portfolio down to 16 stocks.

Currently, I have tweaked my portfolio down to my top 11 performers. Any of these 11 I have held from as little as 7 months, and my oldest up to over a year now. Despite how the markets are at the moment, I am generally happy with the total performance.

Listed below are all of my holdings in order of unrealized gains:

1) Amazon | 35%

2) Apple | 18%

3) Microsoft | 16%

4) Mastercard | 15%

5) Visa | 11%

6) Adobe | 10%

7) Nvidia | 10%

8) Cisco | 8%

9) JPM | 8%

10) Bank of America | 5%

11) Shopify | 5%

As you can see, Amazon DOUBLES Apple, my second-place performer. 4 out of 11 of my holdings are below 10%. Shopify is currently at 5%, and was doing so much better within the last two weeks. At this point, any losses I incur on a day-to-day trading basis are covered by the much larger gains usually from my top 3 or 4.

Now, the problem here is that I am facing a challenge against myself. I chose to diversify my portfolio a long time ago because of mistakes that I had made as a novice. It worked out well. However, now, I want to sell-off my holdings and put all of my eggs in one basket. I want to go 100% Amazon. On one hand, I'm looking at nearly doubling my potential profits. On the other hand, I'm greatly increasing my risks and facing losses at a higher chance than before.

My alternative solution to this risk is becoming a more active trader. Specifically, swing trading. Assuming that I put 100% of my funds into Amazon, I could sell it all off completely on a bad day at a profit, and then buy it back after it has declined some. I would then hold onto it through a typical day or more, and repeat this process. I would be doing this in a strategic attempt to avoid the losses by swing-trading them. For reference, I do not pay to place any trades. I do have a margin account. I have never used it.

I have done a few calculations quickly and found that in a good, conservative month, I could almost double my gains by doing this.

Am I being too optimistic? Dumb, maybe? Would I be better off consolidating my portfolio even more, or leaving it as it is? What other options do I have to continue to tweak my stock choices to improve my numbers?

Thank you!

-There is high quality control, thanks to Amazons commitment to excellent customer service in the returns department. 

-Amazon being involved in the shipping game means that Prime members receive their orders in only 2 days (versus sometimes weeks with EBay and Alibaba)

Could AMZN Buy XRAY?,2,98eef4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/98eef4/could_amzn_buy_xray/,1,1534650525.0,"Amazon to Buy Dentsply Sirona (XRAY) for $52 per share in cash.

A global leader in dental equipment and supply manufacturing, XRAY has lost over 6b in value since July 2017.  

By acquiring Dentsply Sirona, a leader in dental equipment and supply manufacturing and applying its world beating logistics expertise, Amazon could deliver medical devices and products direct to dentists and physicians.  This could be a way to disrupt the medical product industry, undermining distributors such as Patterson Dental and Henry Schein.

Amazon recently bought Whole Foods for $13.4 billion, a 27% premium, a market disrupting transaction in the grocery industry.  This acquisition would be cheaper and immediately establish a dominating market position in dental supplies.  It would also be a ‘back door’ transaction as XRAY markets its products in over 120 countries, with factories in 21 of them.  It’s no secret Amazon is nudging it’s way into the healthcare industry and what better way to start. 

Amazon also has partnerships with some of the largest US distributors such as Cardinal Health.  Ironically, in January 2018, XRAY appointed Don Casey as CEO. Don had been the CEO of the medical segment of Cardinal. 

Similar to the Whole Foods deal, a full takeover of Dentsply Sirona would likely pass regulatory scrutiny and close fairly quickly.

AMZN Meme: investing most of the profits back into the business,2,9jf349,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9jf349/amzn_meme_investing_most_of_the_profits_back_into/,6,1538099642.0,"This meme has been going around for over a decade.  Amazon supporters keep saying Amazon is not showing big profit because they simply are investing all the profits back into the business. Making massive investments.

So I decided to look at the 2017 10-K annual report for Amazon.

Guess what? I can't find all the 'massive' investment.  Looking at the Cash Flow statement Amazon only had about $10 billion in Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development.  This is all under the 'Investment' section of the Cash flow statement. 

So even if Amazon spend $0 on 'investment' their profit would only be $10 billion (amount shown in Cash flow statement for investment) plus the $3 billion in profit.  

So even if Amazon didn't 'invest its profits back into the business' and tried to maximize profits, they would only make $13 billion in profit last year.

$13 billion in profit for a company worth $1 TRILLION. LOL.

And the funny thing about this meme is people are assuming Amazon won't have to 'invest profits' into the company in the future when they decide to maximize profits. LOL. Wrong. They will have to continue to invest in fulfillment centers, data centers, tech, R&D, ect indefinitely.   Those expenses won't just go away.

Of course Amazon supports will say look at the money. Look at the HUGE gains AMZN stock has made.  True. But those past gains have no bearing on the future performance of the stock.  I can point to even more MASSIVE GAINS in Weed stocks and Krypto currency.  

I'm not saying AMZN is a fraud company.  They might even be fairly valued right now.  But it is my opinion that AMZN over the next 5-10 years will underperform the market.",2018-09-28 09:54:02

Overall AMZNs chart looks like it’s cooling down. Could be wrong though.

NKE, same story there. Could’ve gotten out of it Monday or Tuesday for a nice gain but couldn’t due to a holiday. So I’m down on the stock 2.5% currently, but with a decent amount of money it’s definitely not a loss I want to take unnecessarily. How does NKEs chart look?

It has 35% of ridesharing marketshare in America and is rapidly growing in Canada—two of Amazon's biggest market. 

Currently, no major Western ridesharing platform is profitable. That's because it takes a ton of costly promotions and subsidies on both the rider and driver sides to grow a ridesharing platform. 

Amazon, however, could substantially reduce the high cost of new rider acquisition by just offering their over 100 million Prime members a discount for using Lyft over Uber. This would shift marketshare overnight. 

Then, on the driver side, Lyft drivers could be doing last mile order fulfillment for Prime Now and Amazon Restaurant when ride demand is low—effectively increasing driver wages through removing time spent waiting for a new passenger while also lowering Amazon's fulfillment costs. 

The operational efficiencies that come from owning both commerce and ridesharing would allow Amazon to become the most valuable company in the world.

Uber and Amazon are already competing on a ton of fronts. AmazonFresh and UberEats, Uber freight and amazon prime delivery. My money is on Bezos to win though, they can shoulder the massive costs with AWS",2018-10-31 16:57:12

**Pros:**

* Expansion to NY and DC suggests they're getting themselves into fintech and substantial govt contracts
* Way more than just an online store, also getting into health care
* A real market mover; one of the few companies nowadays that still revolutionizes industries
* I think they are somewhat China-neutral.  If China does well, then they might have additional markets, etc.  If China doesn't do well, I think their selling to US market and getting into domestic industries like Health Care and Fintech would still be fine.

**Cons:**

* Has risen quite a bit already in recent years, rise has been meteoric, not sure whether it has room to go.  PE is high.
* Feud between Bezos and Trump might get ugly esp. given former is unwilling to budge and latter is vengeful
* Not a big fan of their Whole Foods acquisition, but it is what it is
* Also, to be level, unclear ultimately whether their initiatives will actually revolutionize the industry or is mere hype
