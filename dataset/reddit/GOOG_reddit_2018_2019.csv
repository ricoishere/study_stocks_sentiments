My Stock Estimates for 2020,0,7ni2nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/7ni2nx/my_stock_estimates_for_2020/,13,1514874068.0,"Today is 1-1-2018.

These are my calls for 1-1-2020. Many of these stocks, whether I predict them to be huge gainers or huge losers, have my attention for these two years.

This is my unprofessional, dumb, beginner attempt to guess what the stock market will be in 2 years if we have a bear market between now and then and if we have a bull market between now and then.

I am not at all predicting this to be accurate. I'm writing this down as a means of reference to see how close or far I was when 1-1-2020 comes.

But GOOGL, the Class A share of Alphabet, has one voting right per share whereas GOOG. the class C share has zero. So usually there will be a slight premium of GOOGL over GOOG. Over the last year, the gap has significantly decreased tho: from $20 to now negative. 

Can this be a temporary inefficiency that can be taken advantage of?

Would like to hear your ideas on this.",2018-03-21 09:40:38

I've been looking into this for quite sometime, without finding anything... is there a company that operate in aereospace or space technology that isn't involved in military or defense?
I was looking at BA and lots of space ETF, but they all have a relation with military/defense.

I would invest in SpaceX if there were public, and I own already GOOG with is a key investor for them.

Can some please ELI5 Options to me? Particularly puts.,2,88jfg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/88jfg9/can_some_please_eli5_options_to_me_particularly/,18,1522539588.0,"Hi all,

I need just a quick explanation on puts and how, under what conditions I can be profitable buying a specific put for a specific date. Or rather, which put I should buy, given my prediction for price action over the coming months.

Basically, I'm of the belief that a crash is fairly likely in the next year, let's not get into that particular debate but let's just assume this is my mindset. I want to buy puts on such over-valued gems as NFLX and TSLA and maybe FB and TWTR and GOOG given the recent FUD on those names and the potential crash I see. But I can't figure out which option to buy and will be profitable at the time closer to expiry if said crash does happen.

Let's just do NFLX as I can extrapolate my belief systems about the others and pick the proper puts once I figure this out. So I suspect NFLX will be sub $200 by next January. I want to buy puts that will be very profitable next January if indeed we see NFLX sub $200. So, should I be looking at the strike price primarily? Obviously I'm looking at January 2019 puts right now. I see $200 strike price, the premium is $9.50ish right now. So what does that mean, like if I buy that option for $9.50, under what conditions will I be profitable come next January or come the crash say if it hits in June or September or whenever if it is well ahead of January?

I know I should probably not buy puts if this stuff isn't clear to me, I have not purchased any and I won't until I am clear on this stuff. This is what I'm trying to do. So let's just look at a few January 2019 NFLX puts, and can you guys explain the various conditions that may take place for that put to be profitable?

$200 strike, $9.50 premium

$150 strike, $4.20 premium

$100 strike, $0.70 premium

And if I wanna go real YOLO with maybe just a few contracts. $50 strike, $0.15 premium.

Or is it easier for me to just say, NFLX, January 2019, if it is $175ish at the time (my belief is it could be there abouts by then) which put should I buy today for the best return? If I get the $200 put for example, and by January 2019 NFLX is $150, then that's bad and I lose either way? Or do I win simply because NFLX is significantly lower then than it is now? This is kinda where my confusion is laying right now.

The plan is probably not to hold until expiry, just hold until it is a highly profitable position, or I guess until what? NFLX reaches the strike price or lower? Then I can exercise for profits? See this is where I'm getting confused here...I'm just not sure, for all of these puts, just how low NFLX has to go for them to become highly profitable positions whether via trading, or via exercising. If NFLX falls to $240 in the next month, do we expect to see really any rise in the $50 strike price options, for example?

Damn options are confusing, I think I get calls a bit more. Like You get a $300 call for $45.58, if by January 2019 NFLX is $345.58 or higher and the option expires, you can buy NFLX shares for $300 + the $45.58 you paid for the option so you are profitable to some extent or another, like if NFLX is $400 you've profited over $50 per share if exercised, I get that, that seems pretty straight forward. But puts are confusing me a bit more, and I'm currently looking bearish, so I want puts not calls of course.

Thanks so much whoever takes the time to read and explain to an options noob like myself. :)

Also do I really need to worry about covered calls? What exactly is that compared to just ""calls""? And are there covered puts? Or a ""covered call"" equivalent in puts?

Thank you :)",2018-04-01 07:39:48

Disney is also moving from consumer discretionary to communications while amazon stays in consumer discretionary  to make it a much larger portion of that sector. How will this effect trading in the short term. I am expecting a little bump in the telecom stocks because they were already undervalued and they are now in the same etf mix with companies like google and facebook.  I think Home Depot will also benefit from amazon being over 20 percent of the consumer discretionary sector. HD is by far the second largest stock in this sector and if it trades closely with amazon that cant hurt. Apple, Microsoft, and Visa are the main information tech so in theory this group should be less volatile without Netflix, Alphabet, and Facebook, but if there is a rotation out of tech ETFs it will effect these stocks  disproportionately.

I actually think i will buy more T and HD because of these moves. T was in the telecom sector and there was not many other stocks lifting that sector up but now it has some FANG attached to it. Home Depot is now more closely tied to Amazon so I don't mind Home Depot as  my only Consumer discretionary stock now. I might actually trim some my two largest positions AAPLE and V because I have too much and  there are some names lower on the list of technology stocks like ADOBE that will probably not be affected by the changes as much and could still move much higher even if people trade out of this sector etf.

With FB's margins, they are able to eat SPOT's current losses and ensure Spotify's mission of capturing market share. 

Also, the sentiment around FB has been pretty ugly. They have only been in the news when they're being attacked for their use of consumer data. I think an acquisition at this level could reverse sentiment as it would signify FB's aggressive approach to future acquisitions and an attempt to diversify their offering.

GOOG, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, FB are all focused right now on one thing - capturing and retaining consumer's attention. I could see Spotify become an arm for content creation for FB: music, audiobooks, podcasts, news - you name it. Spotify has the clean UI and subscription business model to be a one stop shop for those media.

I also think SPOT is a fantastic fit into FB's overall suite, and would fuel their mission of uniting the world. Heck, music is the world's language.

Is FANG maxed out? The most promising technologies of the next decade (2020 and beyond) and which companies to invest in?,227,a0axqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/a0axqy/is_fang_maxed_out_the_most_promising_technologies/,118,1543199474.0,"During a bear market, tech and other growth companies are generally the ones that experience the biggest corrections in share prices due to poor fundamentals and high P/E ratios. However, it doesn't change the fact that investing in general is always about future value. Obviously 'future' is subjective and will vary from person to person, as some people are looking to invest for 5 years while others are looking to set-and-forget for 20+ years, but the point is - people are essentially making a long-term bet that the company will evolve into a stronger leader in its respective industry.

FANG (Facebook ($FB), Amazon ($AMZN), Netflix ($NFLX), and Alphabet ($GOOG)) have been the 4 powerhouse tech stocks that consistently beat the market. As of August 10, 2017 — while the NASDAQ 100 was up 19 percent and the S&P 500 was up 8.9 percent year-to-date (YTD) — FANGs were up more than 2x that of the latter. Year-to-date, Facebook (FB) was up 45 percent, Amazon (AMZN) 27 percent, Netflix (NFLX) 36 percent and Alphabet’s Google (GOOG) 16 percent, beating the returns of both indices. (Source: Yahoo Finance)

As we reach the peak of the 'tech bubble', people have questioned whether the year-over-year growth for FANG is sustainable, while others added to their bullish sentiment with the inclusion of other industry leaders -- In Sept. 2018, CNBC published an article that said that Square ($SQ) should be part of the FANG group based on the hyper-bullish sentiment of a Nomura Instinet analyst, who also set a massive price target of $125 per share.

October 2018 - The Motley Fool came out with an article ([https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/09/forget-fang-stocks-meet-mana.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/09/forget-fang-stocks-meet-mana.aspx)) titled \*Forget FANG Stocks: Meet MANA\* (Microsoft ($MSFT), Apple ($AAPL), Netflix ($NFLX), Amazon ($AMZN))

Q3 ERs for most tech companies were disasters - most beat Q2 expectations, but they slipped on the Q4 guidance. Whether you believe that they are sandbagging is up to you, but people hoped that strong ER and Q4 guidance from FANG/FANGS/FAANG/MANA was going to prop up the market from further slide -- they didn't. If I recall correctly, Netflix was the one that had the strongest ER and jumped nearly 13% in the after hours. Apple bombed on their iPhone sales and announced that going forward, they would no longer be reporting iPhone sales unit numbers. People started to question whether FANG had enough innovation left in their tanks to continue to grow and drive expansion.

\*\*So what's next?\*\* There are a number of advancements that are on the verge of a major breakthrough and adoption:

\* Robotics/AI

\* 5G

\* Quantum computing

\* Internet of Things (IoT)

\* Blockchain (this does not necessarily mean cryptocurrencies)

\* Gene editing/modification

\* Healthcare/Biotech/Pharmaceuticals

What technologies are you bullish on for the future? Which companies are you investing for said tech?

NFLX Question,1,aflt1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/aflt1p/nflx_question/,16,1547431012.0,"Hi all!

I am wondering if NFLX is in for a very rough 2019. 

I like to use Buffett's style of investing -- i.e., if you use something (and you use it frequently etc), it is probably a good choice. 

Within the FANG group, I am currently typing on a Mac, I use Gmail and Google religiously, and Facebook is now everywhere in my life as well for advertising purposes (and has kind of replaced Yahoo as my go-to homepage for garbage news, a surprising success re: their adoption of the new feed). I am also a Netflix user. HOWEVER. 

I have to say that over the past few months, Netflix has begun to lose its luster for me. As I was browsing today, there was no longer anything interesting that caught my eye. They definitely have original content I will watch in the future (the next season of The Crown...?) but even those quality options (House of Cards) are seemingly dwindling. Netflix is increasingly an enormous mass of unwatchable or uninteresting content. 

Does anyone else feel similarly? I could see this seriously impacting their bottom line as we head out another year or two and more and more users begin feeling that Hulu / Amazon Prime have better value. Something else I have been reading is that NFLX quality is declining because noone will license their films / TV to them anymore -- so naturally they are banking on original content, but when your company becomes almost entirely filled with unwatchable original content... that becomes an enormous money waster.

FB, GOOG, AAPL are all smart enough to have developed multiple revenue streams -- I see regular criticism of FB re: more people using IG, and I want to bash my head into a table. But NFLX has not invested in horizontal expansion, instead, they have poured all their $ into themselves, which IMO may turn out to be a very dangerous move, and means they have much less resiliency than FB/GOOG/AAPL. 

Opinions? I do not own stock in NFLX but am considering a short position at some point. ",2019-01-14 09:56:52
